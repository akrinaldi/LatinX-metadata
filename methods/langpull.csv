The smart-city concept has passed through three stages. However, its evolution has not been noted equally throughout countries and their territories. The literature only provides information about specific projects implemented in a few cities. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to study the state-of-the-art of smart cities in Portugal by analyzing 25 editions of the most relevant national-wide smart-cities magazine. First, the objective of analyzing the magazine was to study each Portuguese city in terms of the subject areas and types of existing initiatives in order, ultimately, to frame cities within their respective smart-city phases, as per the literature. Second, the aim of the paper was also to provide information about the evolution of the concept through analyses of embedded experts’ quotes. The results of the first are complemented with the analysis of interviews with policymakers to provide information about the existing challenges to implementing a smart city and to understand the role of government therein. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed on the case study. The findings suggest that the three smart-city phases are perceived in slightly different ways in Portugal and heterogeneity within the country can be noted from the lack of strategies and a standard framework. © 2021 by the authors.

The pedagogical potential of teaching with digital resources, editions and collections remains largely unexplored in the Spanish university context, especially in relation to the study of literary and historical texts. This article reports on a case study at the University of Alicante. An online questionnaire was dispensed to 134 English Studies undergraduates at Alicante in order to elicit the students' responses to electronic resources, their knowledge, uses and attitudes towards them. We also attempted to gauge their engagement with the library services at Alicante and beyond. The results indicate a statistically significant preference for electronic over print resources. Nevertheless, they also suggest the students' low degree of awareness of digital resources and their inability to discriminate between digital resources and general Internet sources. A lack of familiarity with the full potential that libraries offer is also reported, which stresses the need for further training in what seems to be a neglected but crucial area of their studies. © 2021 The Authors",Electronic resources; English studies; Spanish universities; students' responses,,"2020-21; European Research Council, ERC: 2016-2022, H2020-EU.1.1","As recent as June 2021, Huw Jones (Cambridge Digital Humanities) and Dr Laura McCormick Kilbride (Research Fellow in English, Cambridge University) started working on the digitization of the correspondence between the poet and First World War veteran David Jones and his patron Harold Stanley (Jim) Ede, founder of the Kettle's Yard Museum, and there are many other projects well underway.

Although very useful in many applications, the traditional approaches for generating word embeddings have a strict drawback: they produce a single vector representation for a given word ignoring the fact that ambiguous words can assume different meanings. In this paper, we explore unsupervised sense representations which, different from traditional word embeddings, are able to induce different senses of a word by analyzing its contextual semantics in a text. The unsupervised sense representations investigated in this paper are: sense embeddings and deep neural language models. We present the first experiments carried out for generating sense embeddings for Portuguese. Our experiments show that the sense embedding model (Sense2vec) outperformed traditional word embeddings in syntactic and semantic analogies task, proving that the language resource generated here can improve the performance of NLP tasks in Portuguese. We also evaluated the performance of pre-trained deep neural language models (ELMo and BERT) in two transfer learning approaches: feature based and fine-tuning, in the semantic textual similarity task. Our experiments indicate that the fine tuned Multilingual and Portuguese BERT language models were able to achieve better accuracy than the ELMo model and baselines. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",Deep neural language models; Portuguese; Sense embeddings; Word embeddings; Word sense disambiguation,,"2016/13002-0; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP",This work was part of MMeaning Project supported by S?o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP?Regular Grant #2016/13002-0).,,,,,,,,,,"Rodrigues da Silva, J.; Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar)Brazil; email: jsc.rodrigues@gmail.com",,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,1574020X,,,,English,Lang.

Three types of publishers are considered: commercial publishers, scholarly society as publisher, and research organizations as publishers. Indicators of visibility and impact were obtained from Web of Science, SCOPUS, Google Metrics, Scimago Journal Rank and Journal Citation Report. The findings compiled show that in Spain the categories “History and Archaeology” and “Language and Literature” account for almost 70% of the journals analysed, while the other countries offer a more homogeneous distribution. In Finland, the scholarly society publisher is predominant, in Spain, research organization as publishers, mostly universities, have a greater weighting, while in Norway, the commercial publishers take centre stage. The results show that journals from Finland and Norway will have reduced possibilities in terms of impact and visibility, since the vernacular language appeals to a smaller readership. Conversely, the Spanish journals are more attractive for indexing in commercial databases. Distribution in open access ranges from 64 to 70% in Norwegian and Finish journals, and to 91% in Spanish journals.

Natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms are applied to identify the predominant topic related to the elections and the mentions of candidates and political parties by each media, and to calibrate the emotional value of the messages published by El país, El mundo, Eldiario.es, and El confidencial. Among other findings, the results reveal how the media coverage focused mainly on campaign events and electoral debates. Despite the detection of minor differences between the newspapers, a general pattern emerges through this content, with a notable dominance of Isabel Díaz Ayuso but little influence of Rocío Monasterio as the lead candidates for their party. The sentiment analysis reveals the political alignment of each newspaper, using mainly negative messages with the aim of reducing the importance of a candidate or political party. While El país and Eldiario.es focused their criticism on Vox and the Partido Popular, El mundo and El confidencial criticized the actions of the national government, the PSOE’s proposal to join forces with Unidas Podemos, and Vox’s position, as well as emphasizing the disaster faced by Ciudadanos.

The aim is to collect, quantify, classify, and characterize Spanish-produced television series. A methodology with a mixed, quantitative–qualitative design is proposed to quantify, classify, and categorize the 545 identified fictional works. The resulting database includes fields for the year of first broadcast, format, genre, platform, channel, number of episodes and seasons, duration, and rating. This taxonomy is the first to present a complete characterization of all fictional series produced and broadcasted in Spain during the digital era. Based on the results, three periods can be distinguished: the development of the series, the economic crisis of 2008, and the arrival of video-on-demand platforms in Spain. It is concluded that comedies have been overwhelmed by other major genres, such as dramas or police series. Television series are adapting to the new society that consumes them, portraying its social debates, fears, and aspirations through new themes while also reducing their length, mixing some genres with others, and with an increasing presence and prominence of female characters to the detriment of men. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Based on the results obtained from a survey of 2,900 Spanish schoolchildren between the ages of 9 and 17 years conducted at the end of 2018, we explore their attachment to their school, the digital mediation they receive at the center, and their digital competences. The data show that they have a positive feeling of belonging to their school. The most widespread competences among minors are precisely those most related to the playful use of digital devices. Analysis of the association between school mediation and the acquisition of various types of digital skills shows that mediation is effective in the acquisition of most competences among pre-adolescents, confirming the need for early school mediation. There is no doubt that media and digital education contributes to the achievement of more inclusive environments. Educational policies oriented toward safer use of the Internet and a change in the pedagogical paradigm in primary and secondary education should contribute to enhanced development of digital skills during childhood and adolescence. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Previous research has shown that television executives have mental images of their audiences that they actively use in their professional practice. This study adopts a mixed, qualitative-quantitative method to determine the beliefs of Spanish television executives regarding the attitudes of their audiences toward scientific programs and content. The study began with two focus groups, each made up of five professionals, to identify a wide range of attitudes. A Likert-scale questionnaire was then applied to examine the level of agreement with those attitudes among 450 employees of different types of private and public networks from six different regions of Spain. The main findings are that Spanish television managers do not believe that their viewers enjoy scientific topics or have any interest in them. However, professionals with previous experience of the production of scientific content tend to have a slightly more positive attitude about the opinion of general audiences regarding televised science. Hence, familiarity with televised science positively impacts the appreciation of such content on television. This research highlights the fundamental role of network managers in explaining the lack of science on Spanish media. Its results are coherent with previous studies confirming that TV professionals have preconceived images about their audiences that are derived from their own preferences and that guide their decisions. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

A secondary data analysis of surveys published by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research (CIS) is carried out. The existence of relationships between the variables is determined by using the chi-squared hypothesis test, while the strength of the associations is measured by means of the Cramér’s V and the contingency coefficient. Trends are examined by analyzing the conditioned relative frequencies. The results show a strong association between interest in the campaign and the type of medium chosen to obtain information. Likewise, there is a remarkable relationship between the interest of voters and their participation in conversations, especially in family environments, and in the dissemination of digital information about the elections. In contrast, the candidates’ arguments and pledges are not significantly related to the reason for voting. Similarly, demographic variables are weakly related with interest in the campaign, following it on the media, and participation by voting, with educational level being the only characteristic exhibiting moderately strong associations. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Although they are exposed to the dissemination of fake news and hoaxes that fuel tension and damage the health of de-mocracy, they are also propitious spaces to legitimize the media in their responsibility to disseminate rigorous, truthful, and verified information. This research study analyzes the informative discourse on Twitter of the most relevant press, radio, and television outlets in Spain with respect to the formalization of Brexit, i.e., the definitive exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Based on a qualitative methodology, from a sample of 52,188 tweets, the 646 messages about this process, published between December 15, 2020, and January 15, 2021, categorized according to the tags and content distributed on this social network, are analyzed. The work allows the recognition of this discourse, to address its effects in the economic, political, educational, and sports areas. In general, negative language is identified when presen-ting the repercussions of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, especially for Spain. Some media outlets show no interest in the international scope of the process and focus only on the national one. However, most of the messages on Brexit have a pro-European slant, albeit generating little social noise (mainly retweets), with the exception of some users concerned about issues related to the status of Gibraltar, racism, or stereotypes of tourists from the UK. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Spanish-speaking fact-checking is constantly growing, with the number of platforms in Latin America and Spain increasing by more than 100% from 2018 to 2021. Collaboration networks between these platforms are also being implemented to address disinformation beyond national borders in the Spanish-speaking world. However, academic research regarding this phenomenon has mainly focused on fact-checking practices without paying much attention to the professionals themselves: The fact-checkers. Understanding the challenges faced by these professionals in Spanish-speaking contexts is key to contributing to the development of this activity beyond the Anglo-Saxon perspective. In this work, we conducted a survey (n = 52) among Spanish and Latin American fact-checkers. The professionals were asked about their perception on fact-checking’s link to journalism, the competences they believed necessary for fact-checking, the main difficulties they usually face, as well as their thoughts on proposals for potential improvements. The survey results were then enriched by conducting 13 in-depth interviews of Spanish-speaking professionals and academics with expertise in fact-checking. Studying these variables is key to design new, more adequate and attractive curricular proposals to improve the training of future journalists and help them face the enormous and complex but necessary and urgent task of fighting disinformation. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Although one of the guiding pillars of this digital platform is ensuring access to the diversity of human knowledge from a neutral point of view, there is a clear and persistent gender bias in terms of content about or written by women. Through semi-structured interviews with current and former women editors, our research offers a closer look at the different factors that influence editing practices on the Spanish Wikipedia: the educational and social contexts that prompt women to start or stop editing; their perceptions of the treatment of gender equality in the encyclopedia; and their feelings about taking part in the creation of content in an environment where they find themselves in a minority. Self-organized events known as edit-a-thons (in Spanish, Wikiquedadas), where women meet to discuss and share editing practices, have emerged as self-inclusion strategies to enable more women to enter, remain, and be recognized in this male-dominated editing environment. Smaller Wikipe-dia communities are also perceived as more inclusive environments. Lack of digital competences or difficulty using the platform do not appear to be aspects that negatively influence the participation of women in the editing process, though time spent on unpaid care work does seem to be a critical factor. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The objective of this work is to identify the impact, repercussions, and challenges after these crises and to try to describe both the role that public libraries must fulfill from this moment on, as well as the main training, or-ganizational, and service needs that they must address. The applied methodology is mixed, applying several qualitative research techniques such as interviews with experts and discussion groups with library professionals together with a review of documents and good practices. The results reveal how the accumulation of negative effects has generated very diverse impacts, depending on various factors such as the size of the municipality, the degree of institutional support, or the job profiles of library staff. The social function of the library has been valued, as well as the work of inclusion and digital training, which after the pandemic is conceived in a unitary way. Likewise, there is an increase in the gap between libraries because the forms of response to crises depend on their context due to the absence of regional or national policies that support and harmonize the provision of minimum services or basic professional training. It is concluded that there is a need to articulate a new model of public libraries according to the current requirements of society and the general digital transformation. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Literature review shows that the research on fact-checking has focused on the origin, funding, relationship with the media, procedures, and experiences related to politics and COVID-19. However, the ownership structure of the fact-checking services has been superficially analysed and the business model of these platforms has not yet been studied in detail and depth. The objective of this article is to identify and analyse the business model of the nine Spanish active fact-checking services through a documentary research of public information sources and the information that these services give about themselves. This paper explains their ownership structure and income provenance, from open information sources. The findings are that the fact-checking services that depend on media groups are no strangers to the trend of opacity usual in these groups, but in the case of fact-checking services that are born as initiatives of journalists, the trend towards transparency is, in the majority of cases, clear. However, the information provided by the Spanish fact-checking services is deficient and does not allow us to discover their business models, except in the case of Newtral and, to a certain extent, Maldita. © 2021 by the authors.

Maldita also receives income from collaborations in the national media, mainly on the radio (Onda Cero, RNE) and television (TVE, Tele-madrid, and Cuatro). Different philanthropic associations contribute with grants: Google (twice—Google News initiative and Google.org Impact Challenge), Ashoka Fellowship, International Fact-Checking Network and Open Society Foundation for Europe, member of the international network founded by the magnate George Soros. Again, Google seems, along with Facebook, to be a source of financial resources for Maldita, under the heading of “technological alliances”. Lastly, Maldita receives aid from public competitions and grants, “which never directly affect its editorial content” and from other educational projects and services. In short, the organisation’s revenue comes from philanthropic grants, tech alliances, media collaborations, and community contributions.","Funding: This work was supported by S29_20R-GICID (Research Group on Digital Communication and Information), Government of Aragon–Spain, BOA No. 62, dated 26 March 2020.

This justifies a detailed examination of the Spanish scientific production in this journal. At the same time, the work of editing monographic issues in which papers with Spanish authors have been published is analyzed. For this purpose, we have identified whether each paper belongs to regular or to special issues of the journal, identifying whether the author of the paper is also editor of the monograph, or a university colleague. The nationality of the editors was also studied. The subject matter of the articles and their belonging to the area of the journal were analyzed. Most of the papers published by Spanish authors were published in special issues (81.6%), mainly edited by authors of the same nationality (63.1%). It is also found that there is an important production carried out by the same editor of the monograph, or by colleagues from the same institution. It is also found that a substantial number of works published in Sustainability (42.3%) have minimal or no relationship with the subject of sustainability. Finally, the implications of these findings are discussed under the light of the publication strategies of Spanish researchers and the science evaluation policies applied in Spain. The main controversial aspects identified have to do with the publication of papers on other subjects, the value of publishing in monographs, which in some cases could be considered as inbreeding, and the short editing times. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The results show the belief and dissemination of (fake) news are related to the political ideology of the participants, with right-wing subjects exhibiting a greater tendency to accept fake news, regardless of whether it is pro-left or pro-right fake news. These findings contradict the confirmation bias and may suggest that a greater influence of factors such as age, the level of digital news literacy and psychological aspects in the judgment of fake news are at play. Older and less educated respondents indicated they believed and would disseminate fake news at greater rates. Regardless of the ideology they favor, the Portuguese attributed higher credibility to the sample’s real news, a fact that can be meaningful regarding the fight against disinformation in Portugal and elsewhere. © 2021 by the authors.

The project is implemented as part of the Digital Poland Operational Program for 2014–2020 by the Płużnica Commune Development Association in partnership with the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs and the Foundation of Active Development Initiatives. The authors limit themselves to presenting results of 75 trainings only in the municipalities of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, in which they had conducted the trainings on their own, in the capacity of certified instructors of digital competences, in the period of December 2018 – end of June 2019. Each participant of the training was obliged to take a pre-test consisting in 10 single-choice questions, that verified his digital competences (like use of search engines, digital resources, e-administration services, tools of cybersecurity). At the end of the training (consisting of the lecture with the presentation of tools) each participant had to solve the post-test to validate his knowledge (again, 10 single-choice questions with the pass threshold score of 75% of correct answers). Comparing the results of both tests, the authors of this article assessed the level of digital competence of participants’ group before and after the trainings. The conducted analyses proved that all the training groups increased their levels of digital competences. In the case of almost 55% of groups, an increase by one level was evidenced (51% for average to high competences, and 4% for low to average competences), and in the case of 35% of groups — by two levels (from low to high competences). Slightly above 10% of groups increased their already high level of competences that was featured initially. The obtained results are the evidence of the high effectiveness of the trainings. In their final outcome, as much as 72 training groups increased their initial levels of digital competences to the high level, and 3 to the average level. There was no group reported with a drop in the level of competences. The results of analyses indicate high effectiveness of the trainings conducted within the scope of the “E-Active Residents of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian and Łódź Voivodeships” project – at least with respect to the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. A large number of participants featuring average and low digital competences (89% before the training and 96% after the trainings) may be evidence for the unsatisfactory level of digital competences in Poland. On the other hand, a relatively high interest in the trainings among the seniors (aged 61 or older), may indicate that there is still a considerable need in Poland for initiating actions countering the digital exclusion. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Digital competences; Digital inclusion; ICT; Trainings; “E-active”,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kowalska-Chrzanowska, M.; Nicolaus Copernicus University.

We analyze if, in the case of 8M in Spain, digital feminist activism constituted a challenge to the hegemonic frames of representation of gender-based violence. Using the concept of “ethical testimony,”, we demonstrate the opportunity that giving testimony on gender-based violence offers to digital feminist activism to act in an effective, political manner on Twitter, circumventing invisibility. These hashtags do not form strong conversational communities but rather serve to diffuse messages at a mass scale. Within these conversational communities, the term “victim” is rarely utilized, which we interpret as an accomplishment of women as agents capable of resisting their position of vulnerability. © The Author(s) 2019.",ethical witnessing; feminist digital politics; gender-based violence; Spanish hashtag feminism; twitter,,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research project ref #: FEM2015-65834-C2-1-P funded by the grant MINECO I+D+i Subprogram of Generation of Knowledge, State Program for the Promotion of Excellence in Scientific and Technical Research of the National Plan for Research, Development and Innovation of the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity.",,,,,,,,,,"Puente, S.N.; Universidad Rey Juan CarlosSpain; email: sonia.puente@urjc.es",,SAGE Publications Inc.,8944393,,,,English,Soc.

Sceptical authors believe that OAMJs are simply an easy target to publish uninteresting papers that would not be accepted in more selective traditional journals. The purpose of this paper is to investigate any differences in scholars’ considerations of OAMJs by analysing the productivity and impact of Spanish authors in Biology and Medicine who publish in PLOS ONE. Design/methodology/approach: Scopus was used to identify the most prolific Spanish authors in Biology and Medicine between 2013 and 2017 and to determine their publication patterns in PLOS ONE. Any differences in terms of citation impact between Spanish authors who publish frequently in PLOS ONE and the global Spanish output in Biology and Medicine were measured. Findings: Results show a moderate correlation between the total number of articles published by prolific authors in Biology and Medicine and the number of articles they publish in PLOS ONE. Authors who publish frequently in PLOS ONE tend to publish more frequently than average in Quartile 1 and Top 10 per cent impact journals and their articles are more frequently cited than average too, suggesting that they do not submit to PLOS ONE for the purpose of gaining easier publication in a high-impact journal. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited to one country, one OAMJ and one discipline and does not investigate whether authors select PLOS ONE for what they might regard as their lower quality research. Originality/value: Very few studies have empirically addressed the implications of the soundness-based peer-review policy applied by OAMJs. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Mega-journals; Open access; PLOS ONE; Spain,Open access; Bibliometric analysis; Biology and medicine; Citation impact; Design/methodology/approach; Mega-journals; PLOS ONE; Policy-based; Spain; Biology; article; biology; human; peer review; productivity; publication; Scopus; Spain; systematic review,,,,,,,,,,,,"Borrego, Á.; Universitat de BarcelonaSpain; email: borrego@ub.edu",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,14684527,,OIRNA,,English,Online Info.

Those first pages are a perfect hook for newspapers to attract readers; thus, it becomes vital to show striking pieces of information, captivating the audience. In the case of the written sport press in Spain, there is a key period in which true information is mingled with half-truths and even rumors: The summer transfer window. This paper shows an analysis of the front-page news appearing in the Spanish sports newspapers Marca, As, Mundo Deportivo, and Sport, over a five-year period (2015–2019), based on a sample of 120 different issues of the newspaper. Many times, the media present information either as something true or as a hypothesis or possibility. After quantitatively analyzing that, it can be noticed that in more than 50% of the cases, the signing or sale of the player referenced on the front page (the main news) does not occur. Similarly, it can be observed that there is a direct link connecting the news referring to Real Madrid with Marca and As, and Fútbol Club Barcelona with Mundo Deportivo and Sport. Finally, almost 100% of this news is showed along with real photo-graphs, using photo montage in just a few cases. © 2021 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: The study sample comprised 78 home pages from the institutional websites of the 47 cultural, natural and mixed assets considered as World Cultural Heritage by The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco). These home pages have been analysed using online accessibility validator tools, following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 recommendation for the different levels of priority. The compiled data were employed in a quantitative study on adherence to WCAG guidelines. Furthermore, the types of errors made using the perspective of accessibility and usability were identified, and the application rate was calculated for these accessibility guidelines according to the type of entity managed by the websites and pages. Findings: The results show that more than 25 percent of the cases analysed had ten accessibility errors or fewer. Moreover, it was only necessary to correct one or two types of errors in close to 40 percent of them. The paper draws the conclusion that, despite technological and legislative advances that make public entity websites accessible, there is still much to do before complete web accessibility and usability at AA and AAA level can be achieved. Practical implications: Identifying accessibility problems on institutional websites constitutes the first step towards creating web content that is easy to access and manage for users with disabilities. In this regard, this study contributes to improving web content according to objective guidelines such as those encouraged by the WCAG 2.0. Originality/value: This article provides information on how accessibility and usability guidelines are implemented by institutional websites for Cultural Heritage deemed especially important. This is an issue with significant implications for users and for which, however, there is a lack of prior studies.

Second, the lack of strict orthographic standards. Finally, diachronic and geographical variations in Spanish from the 12th to 15th century. In this period, named entities usually appear as complex text structure. For example, it was frequent to add nicknames and information about the persons role in society and geographic origin. To tackle this complexity, named entity recognition and classification system has been implemented. The system uses contextual cues based on semantics to detect entities and assign a type. Given the occurrence of entities with attached attributes, entity contexts are also parsed to determine entity-type-specific dependencies for these attributes. Moreover, it uses a variant generator to handle the diachronic evolution of Spanish medieval terms from a phonetic and morphosyntactic viewpoint. The tool iteratively enriches its proper lexica, dictionaries, and gazetteers. The system was evaluated on a corpus of over 3,000 manually annotated entities of different types and periods, obtaining F1 scores between 0.74 and 0.87. Attribute annotation was evaluated for a person and role name attributes with an overall F1 of 0.75. © 2020 The Authors.

This 40-item survey included questions about students’ self-perception of their information skills and a test for evaluating their basic IL skills. Design/methodology/approach: This research focused on integrating IL into a bachelor program in Spanish literature to identify the IL skills that students were familiar with and then determine if there was a relationship among their IL skills, their academic performance and their favorable conditions as students (have a good number of books at home, a personal computer, internet connection and proficiency in a second language). Findings: The average number of correct answers ranged from regular to low; moreover, the authors compared self-perception results before and after the IL test, proving that such test negatively affected their self-perception. Students were mostly familiar with the skill of selecting information, and the inferential analysis showed that there were no notable relationships among either the IL test results and students’ academic performance or regarding their favorable conditions as students. This made evident the need of promoting ACRL’s Guidelines, particularly among literature professors, to raise awareness of their existence, as they are a useful starting point for designing contents and activities to develop IL. Originality/value: Little research has been conducted about implementing IL in bachelor programs on literature to determine their information skills and behaviors in digital environments. Apart from grounding the research in specialized sources about research in such discipline, the authors have adapted ACRL’s Guidelines to develop a diagnostic survey that may be useful for professors in these areas and academic librarians in general. It might be useful for librarians to be familiar with the nuances of the results the authors gathered to provide better support for their users from the discipline of literature. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Information competence; Information literacy; Literature education; Quantitative studies; Students; Undergraduate studies,Libraries; Personal computers; Surveys; Academic performance; Bachelor programs; Design/methodology/approach; Digital environment; Favorable conditions; Information literacy; Internet connection; Research libraries; Students,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","The authors wish to thank the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT, Mexico) for supporting Rita Cid with a national scholarship throughout her studies in the Master in Educational Innovation (PNPC Program).",,,,,,,,,,"Machin-Mastromatteo, J.D.; Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, Mexico; email: judamasmas@gmail.com",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,20595816,,,,English,Digit.

A fundamental part of the contribution is the analysis of the famous articles by Luigi Crocetti and Diego Maltese on the Italian edition of ISBD (G), edited by Rossella Dini in 1987.

This article relates to one of the casualties of the uprising. Few would have been aware that the unassuming Italian refugee Giovanni Batista Testa, living as a language teacher in Doncaster for over five decades from 1825, had played a part in the early events of the Risorgimento. Abandoning his post in a leading law firm in Turin, he became involved in the unsuccessful constitutionalist insurrection there in the spring of 1821 and was obliged to flee for his life. He subsequently became a historian of twelfth-century Lombardy, and achieved reconciliation with his country through the award of a knighthood in 1854 by the Kingdom of Sardinia for this achievement. He later received a second knighthood from the new kingdom of a united Italy. Before his return to Italy in 1881 he dictated an autobiographical memoir describing his four years of transition from Italy to England between 1821 and 1824 and some significant aspects of his subsequent life up to the date of his first knighthood. The memoir is of sufficient interest to merit republication two centuries after its principal events took place. This preliminary commentary focuses upon the English context of his narrative and continues his story up to his death. © 2021 Liverpool University Press.

In this regard, the mid-2010s saw a whole phase of experimentation that began with so-called immersive journalism, a new way of producing news content using virtual reality and 360° video, which introduced various novelties in the way stories are both told and consumed/watched. Among these, 360° real-image videos are the most common form, which can be partly explained by factors such as time and cost, although it is also possible to find completely computer-generated (CG) nonfiction experiences. Legacy media such as The New York Times, El País, or the BBC have been experimenting with the possibilities of this immersive storytelling, but what about digital native media? The aim of this paper is to ex-plore the use of 360° video by Spanish digital native media in order to observe the degree of development of immersive storytelling, as well as the quality of the pieces available more than 5 years after the start of this phenomenon known as immersive journalism. For this purpose, a content analysis of 360° videos published during the period 2015-2019 by El español, eldiario.es, El independiente, and El HuffPost has been carried out. The study of these particular cases reveals the absence of a narrative strategy aligned with the immersive format; in general, these are simple videos that provide little added value compared with the conventional format. Furthermore, the results show that the history of immersive journalism by these cybermedia has been limited in terms of both volume and time, with little guarantee that it will continue into the future. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Public libraries and archives are not only information suppliers, but also public bodies obliged to provide the citizenry with information about their own governance and activities. Those obligations are laid down in Spanish Act 19/2013 of 29 December on Transparency, Access to Public Information and Good Governance (Spanish initials LTAIPBG). This article describes the results of applying a transparency measuring tool, TransPa_BA, to 106 regionally administered national historic archives and national public libraries. The tool, in turn the result of a research project, includes 20 indicators to measure active public disclosure by public libraries and 22 by archives in keeping with the provisions of the aforementioned Act. The indicators and their respective parameters (visibility, content, form, accessibility, reusability, dating and currency) provide guidelines to enable these institutions to comply with transparency and accountability requirements by furnishing society in general and their stakeholders in particular with information on their activities and performance in key areas. Further to the findings, the target institutions have made hesitant attempts to enhance transparency with respect to earlier inquiries. Public libraries are observed to be more active than archives, although the transparency scores obtained are low due to the failure to provide information on some indicators as well as on parameters such as dating and reusability. Both types of institution have a long road ahead in the pursuit of greater transparency. © The Author(s) 2021.",Active disclosure; archives; libraries; Spain; transparency,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU: RTI2018-095187-B-100","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities under project RTI2018-095187-B-100.",,,,,,,,,,"Pacios, A.R.; University Carlos IIISpain; email: areyes@bib.uc3m.es",,SAGE Publications Ltd,9610006,,,,English,J.

The results indicate the following: (1) the vast majority of the databases analysed employ search models based exclusively on a calendar or text box, thus hindering the selective retrieval of information; (b) a large proportion of these databases do not allow users to employ several fields in order to filter and narrow down their searches; and (3) all the online news databases lack search guides and controlled vocabularies or thesauruses.

As expected, the government has been the main source of official information in most countries, but the crisis has also affected political communication models and the management of crisis communication and misinformation. In this scenario, the level of trust in the government and political polarization have become crucial variables to understand how citizens perceive and receive communicate about the effects of the pandemic in their daily life. To address these issues in the case of Spain, in November 2020 we conducted the first nationally representative survey to analyze the level of trust that citizens have in public information on Covid-19 provided by the national government. The findings reveal that their perceptions regarding the quality of such information, the media used for its transmission, and the communication management by the Government during the pandemic were rather negative, although some sociodemographic differences are obser-ved.

The main results indicate that, although there is a greater tradition of including acknowledgments in its articles in Scientometrics, the Spanish journal achieves a much higher Variation Rate in 2018 compared to 1998, which indicates a very positive evolution of the Spanish journal; they also reflect that the common practice in both journals consists more in mentioning people who have helped in the research, and not so much the institutions; and, finally, that there is a moderate positive correlation between the number of appearances of the authors in the acknowledgments and their h-index, so it would be possible to use the acknowledgments to measure scientific activity. © 2021.

It is based on a bilingual terminological perspective oriented to evaluate and compare the terms used to describe and communicate the pandemic's issues both to biomedical experts and to a non-specialist public. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis carried out is a terminological comparative investigation performed on two corpora, the first containing scientific English articles, the second Italian national newspapers' issues on two pandemics, the Spanish flu and the current Covid-19 disease, towards the detection of semantic similarities and differences among them through the implementation of computational tasks and corpus linguistics methodologies. Findings: Given the cross-fielding representativeness of terms, and their relevance within specific historical eras, our study is conducted both on a synchronic and on a diachronic level to discover the common lexical usages in the dissemination of the pandemic issues. Originality/value: The study presents the extraction of the main representative terms about two pandemics and their usages to share news about their trends among the population and the integration of a topic modeling detection procedure to discover some of the main categories representing the lexicon of the pandemics with reference to a list of classes created by external thesauri and ontologies on pandemics. As a result, a detailed overview of the discrepancies, as well as similarities, retrieved in two historical corpora dealing with a common subject, i.e. the pandemics' terminology, is provided. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Covid-19; Pandemics; Spanish flu; Terminological evaluation; Topic modelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lanza, C.; Department of Culture, Italy; email: claudia.lanza@unical.it",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,220418,,,,English,J.

Design/methodology/approach: Survey data from 172 Italian SMEs was collected through an online questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (partial least square). Findings: Results show that KM practices have a positive direct impact on each IC component which influences PE. Finally, structural capital and PE have a positive direct impact a firm’s ability to innovate. Research limitations/implications: For researchers, this paper fills an important gap in the academic literature by conceptualizing and empirically testing the link between IC and PE. The main practical implication of this study is that developing intangible resources is of particular importance for strategic decision-making in SMEs. The focus on Italian SMEs limits the generalizability of the results. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence on how KM and IC interact and mutually drive PE.

The article explores the nature of Buchanan’s intellectual project by focussing on the relationship of his thought to the ‘Italian tradition’, which he encountered during his year in Italy as a Fulbright Fellow. It is a tradition that encompasses both classical works of public finance and the ‘elite theory’ associated with Pareto and Mosca. An awareness of the importance of this Italian year helps us to reframe Buchanan’s intellectual development. Furthermore, while he strove to exclude analyses of socio-economic power from his work, its proximity to a tradition in which this was a core concern throws into relief the points at which he chose not to pursue such considerations, forcing us to ask why. This article provides an answer. It concludes that, despite his efforts, Buchanan was forced to confront the reality of private power, as can be seen in his proposals for a confiscatory rate of inheritance tax. A response is also made to the controversy associated with Nancy MacLean’s recent work on Buchanan. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Buchanan; democracy; elite theory; neoliberalism; public choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Irving, S.; John Rylands Research Institute, United Kingdom; email: sean.irving@manchester.ac.uk",,Taylor and Francis,23801883,,,,English,Glob.

The analysis is aimed specifically at advancing hypotheses regarding the transmission of four manuscript volumes entitled Répression du brigandage dans les Deux-Siciles au XIXe siècle, written during the socalled French Decade (1806-1815) of the Kingdom of Naples, and how they were purchased by the BNF in the 1860s. The study is the result of ongoing research conducted at the BNF Department of manuscripts. The essay offers a historiographical excursus aimed at framing the need for a return to these sources in the context of the studies conducted so far. Furthermore, it intends to explain the presence of the singular collection in the Italian fund of the Library, attempting to reconstruct the events of the archive and highlighting the new results of the survey. The collection remained in private hands for a long time, at least from 1814-1815 to 1863, before moving on to the archives of the Library, where almost immediately it found its place in the newly born Italian fund. It was acquired by the BNF by a not better defined «mademoiselle Année», a personality hitherto unknown, and on which this essay tries to shed clarity. © 2021 Associazione Italiana Biblioteche.

Of the 11 categories of discriminationcontemplatedbytheSpanishMinistryofInternalAffairs, thesecondinwhich the most hate crimes are registered per year is political ideology. However, this category falls outside of most action plans to study and combat hate crimes. The same occurs in the case of academic works since most focus on analyzing and detecting hate in English and at a general level. The few authors who have targeted their studies to a single type of hate to improve accuracy, have focused on racism, xenophobia, or gender discrimination, but never on political ideology. Furthermore, the detection prototypes developed so far have not used databases generated manually by various coders.

However, most of them are based on texts in prose, lacking applications that work with poetry texts. An example of an application of text mining in poetry is the usage of features derived from their individual words in order to capture the lexical, sublexical and interlexical meaning, and infer the General Affective Meaning (GAM) of the text. However, even though this proposal has been proved as useful for poetry in some languages, there is a lack of studies for both Spanish poetry and for highly-structured poetic compositions such as sonnets. This article presents a study over an annotated corpus of Spanish sonnets, in order to analyse if it is possible to build features from their individual words for predicting their GAM. The purpose of this is to model sonnets at an affective level. The article also analyses the relationship between the GAM of the sonnets and the content itself. For this, we consider the content from a psychological perspective, identifying with tags when a sonnet is related to a specific term. Then, we study how GAM changes according to each of those psychological terms. The corpus used contains 274 Spanish sonnets from authors of different centuries, from fifteenth to nineteenth. This corpus was annotated by different domain experts. The experts annotated the poems with affective and lexico-semantic features, as well as with domain concepts that belong to psychology. Thanks to this, the corpus of sonnets can be used in different applications, such as poetry recommender systems, personality text mining studies of the authors, or the usage of poetry for therapeutic purposes. © 2021, The Author(s).",Affective; NLP; Poetry; Psychology; Semantic; Spanish sonnets,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; European Research Council, ERC","Poetry Standardization and Linked Open Data, Ref.

Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical and applied investigation using mixed methods to collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data from three sources: the Internet Archive and the public collection of Archive-It, the Portuguese web archive, and a selection from collections compiled by a research group (UFRGS) on web archiving and digital archiving in Brazil. Findings: Web archive initiatives started in 1996; however, over the years collections have narrowed from nationally relevant themes to specialized thematic niches. The theme “climate change” has had an increasing impact on scientific and mainstream discussion in the 2000s, and by 2010 the over-arching theme became focused on digital preservation of web content, as demonstrated in this study. Failure to preserve data can lead to a rapid loss of climate change information, due to the inherent ephemerality of the web. Originality/value: The paper demonstrates the relevance of preserving web content on climate change by showing what has been preserved to date and what will need to be preserved in the future. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Climate change; Digital archives and libraries; Digital preservation; Web archiving,,"Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES",This study was financed in part by the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES) – Finance Code 001.

Of these 800 million users, 41% are aged between 16 and 24 years. This social network, widely known for its entertainment videos, is increasingly becoming a place for political discussion and therefore a unique opportunity for political actors to (re) connect with young people. Acknowledging that the political uses of TikTok are still understudied, this paper aims to explore whether and how Spanish political parties are including TikTok as part of their communication strategy. Through an affordance-centered content analysis of all the posts published by the five most important Spanish political parties (PP, PSOE, Ciudadanos, Podemos, and Vox), the current results show that, although all Spanish political parties have adopted this platform, their usage is unequal. From a quantitative perspective, PP was the first party to open a TikTok account, but its usage has been discontinuous; Podemos and Ciudadanos are the parties that publish the most and most constantly, while Vox has only published nine posts and the PSOE one. Nonetheless, from a qualitative perspective, Podemos and Vox generate more engagement and seem to understand and exploit TikTok’s specific affordances better. The findings allow it to be concluded that, although globally Spanish political parties do not fully exploit the platform’s affordances and tend to use it as a unilateral tool for promotion, the most engaging posts are those favoring interaction and geared toward politainment. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Such networks are built from papers indexed in the ‘Communication’ category by Web of Science and published between 2000 and 2019 by authors attached to a Spanish or Latin American institution (n = 5,040). The goal is to characterize the structural fea-tures of each network, identify the most central actors, and illustrate the most relevant relationships among nodes. The results show that the most central country is Spain, followed by the USA and other European nations. Among the Latin American states, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico are placed at the most relevant nodes. Latin American collaboration is prefe-rentially addressed to the USA, especially since 2015. Regarding institutions, Spanish public universities in Madrid and Catalonia achieve the highest degrees of centrality. However, the most central Latin American institutions are private universities. The most relevant authors are Spanish researchers until 2015, when they are replaced at the top by Latin American scholars. Collaboration at both the individual and institutional levels shows a deep regional tendency, while the internationalization of researchers and universities is only more visible since 2015. This work identifies a tendency towards internal cohesion at different network levels as the number of connected nodes grows in each period. We con-clude that a proper Spanish-Latin America community of communication researchers does not exist. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The first is the journalistic system itself (business models, professional routines, information consumption, etc.). The second aspect involves the teaching guidelines established as a result of the implementation of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Focusing on the latter issue, the cu-rrent debate regarding the orientation of journalistic education is calling for this aspect not to be relegated or limited to training in technical skills, which are constantly being renewed by technological developments of the digital environ-ment. On the contrary, journalism education must also take into account other skills that foster the achievement of criti-cal thinking, which is fundamental for the exercise of the journalistic profession. However, in the face of an increasingly digitised, competitive labour market, journalism studies and their training programmes also have a duty to provide the skills and competencies demanded by this market. In this paper, we have conducted a systematic review of some of the experiences of innovative teaching that have been successfully carried out in Journalism degrees taught in Spain for this purpose (service-learning, project-based learning, content curation, and edublogs, among others). These experiences reflect the involvement of university professors in providing comprehensive education for future journalists, with a strong emphasis on the intensive use of the digital resources currently available. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The results demonstrate that Spanish universities achieve low positions on international rankings when analyzed using this multivariate and dynamic approach. Indeed, only a small percentage occupy good positions in both studied rankings and stand out in terms of some of the indicators, whereas most achieve weak scores in the global context. Spanish universities should attempt to improve this situation, since the prestige resulting from a good position on these lists will always be beneficial in terms of the visibility of both the universities themselves and the whole Spanish university system. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

This research analyzes how Spanish Communication research groups take advantage of the functionalities of the web 2.0 to transfer knowledge and promote closer collaboration with other academic entities. The starting point is an exhaustive census of research groups, prepared within the research project MapCom 2 and including groups belonging to communication faculties of public and private universities in Spain. Content analysis is then applied to examine how these groups use their respective websites, exploring six variables: navigability, dissemination of information and services, updating, international projection, SEO positioning, and possibilities of interaction with the audience. The analysis of the sites reveals disparate results in terms of the type of update, content, functionalities, and uses. Most of the groups listed have websites to present their lines of research and objectives. However, these spaces vary from one group to another (even within the same university), and many asymmetries can be detected in the information presented and in the fact that certain statements are not always accessible. The study of these variables –composed and designed for the present research– also allows us to analyze the knowledge transfer that the groups carry out, their possible level of interaction with citizens, or to determine whether they are more or less endogamic or have an external projection when promoting links with other members or groups at a local, state, or international level. The results show that Spanish groups have not yet managed to exploit the opportunities of the web 2.0 sufficiently to transfer knowledge as well as export and increase the visibility of their scientific production. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

This article studies Instagram from a differential perspective from previous studies by analyzing the strategic management of the photo-text binomial on this social network within the context of political communication. The methodological design of this research consists of a quantitative approach based on content analysis. Relying on a model of analysis developed by us, we revised three categories associated with the central parameters of the photographic image, the text, and their interrelationship during the campaign for the Spanish election of 28 April (dated between the 12 and 26 April 2019, both inclusive). The selection of this period is due to the belief that this is a key moment in the political sphere because it invoked great social interest and information consumption and, consequently, greater concern from the parties about the strategic communication of their political actions. The sample comprised 314 posts published by the five main Spanish parties and their respective leaders, candidates for the Government’s Presidency. The results reveal that complementarity dominates as the main form of interaction between the two components (image and text), albeit with a significant presence of problematic interaction types such as redundancy or independence. Despite the progressive professionalization of the political use of social networks, it was found that the potentially effective use of the verbal–icon tandem is not currently applied on Instagram as a strategic approach for political communication. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

From the instrumental point of view, a “General Web Quality Index” was designed, that served to specify the national performance level, which was close to correct, as well as to conclude that the country’s continental coastline, the most populated, rich and developed area, is precisely where e-government is best implemented.

Via these functions we address the discrepancies between the two countries considering the materiality of the penny prints, the growth of the production, but also the transition from a predominantly religious, towards a more profane content. Striking was the lack of educative and edifying initiatives in Spain in contrast to the Dutch ideological strategies. We observed some interesting similarities as well. Although in both countries penny prints often conformed to current ideologies and institutions, there were instances in which penny prints and aleluyas were used as instruments of social satire or resistance. A few similar strange twists in the adaptations of literary classics, seem to suggest some form of transnational exchange or at least imitation. © Juan Gomis and Jeroen Salman, 2021.",Adaptation; Aleluyas; Penny prints; Popularisation; Social functions; Spain; The Netherlands,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU: PGC2018-097445-A-C22; Conselleria de Innovación, Universidades, Ciencia y Sociedad Digital, Generalitat Valenciana, CIUCSD: GV/2020/207","Research for this chapter was funded in part by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (PGC2018-097445-A-C22) and by the Valencian Conselleria of Innovation, Universities, Science and Digital Society (GV/2020/207).",,,,,,,,,,,,Brill Academic Publishers,149527,,,,English,Quaerendo,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106492811

However, less is known about how this phenomenon is playing out in developing regions, including Spanish-speaking Latin America. This study presents the results of a survey of 104 academic librarians in this region, along with follow-up interviews with seven respondents. The findings reveal that scholarly publishing literacy in general, and predatory publishing in particular, currently has low visibility in this part of the world, although there is growing recognition of and increasing concern about the issue. Although there is some debate about whether scholarly publishing literacy should be the sole responsibility of the library, many participants agree that the library has a role to play. Moreover, while most of the librarians who participated perceive that they have a solid knowledge of open access, they are less confident in their understanding of predatory practices and are seeking to increase their skills and knowledge in this regard to better support researchers at their institutions. To address this shortcoming, academic librarians in the region have expressed an interest in receiving training and in participating in international collaborations with other libraries that have already developed resources or programming in this area. © The Author(s) 2021.",Academic libraries; open access; predatory publishing; scholarly communication; scholarly publishing literacy; Spanish-speaking Latin America,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Buitrago Ciro, J.; University of OttawaCanada; email: jbuit008@uottawa.ca",,SAGE Publications Ltd,9610006,,,,English,J.

The aim of the present study was to analyse the value-added services offered by institutional repositories in Spanish public universities. Method. Information was collected on the main characteristics of repositories in Spanish public universities and the value-added services they offered, using a checklist with twenty-five items divided into three dimensions: information on the repository; information on the records; and instructions for use and dissemination. Analysis. We determined the frequency of each value-added service in the repositories included in the study and analysed the main modalities in which these services were offered. We also analysed the similarity between repositories using multidimensional scaling methods. Results. We found high variability between repositories and indicated that some value-added services were widely offered whereas others were only provided by a few repositories. Conclusions. We believe that the provision of value-added services could have a direct impact on repository use because such services are related to many of the reasons that explain repository under-utilisation, such as low perceived usefulness, difficulties depositing work and lack of knowledge about what should or can be deposited. © the author, 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Boras,13681613,,,,English,Inf.

We examined the relationship between Italian news media coverage of COVID-19 and compliance with stay-at-home orders, which could impact the spread of epidemics. We used a computational method for framing analysis (ANTMN) and combined it with Google’s Community Mobility data. A time-series analysis using vector autoregressive models showed that the Italian media used media frames that were largely congruent with ones used by journalists in other countries: A scientific frame focusing on symptoms and health effects, a containment frame focusing on attempts to ameliorate risks, and a social frame, focusing on political and social impact. The prominence of different media frames over time was associated with changes in Italians’ mobility patterns. Specifically, we found that the social frame was associated with increased mobility, whereas the containment frame was associated with decreased mobility.

This article examines the post-migration changes in reading practices of Spanish-speaking readers in the U.S. and Canada, with a goal of translating the findings into practical guidelines for librarians who engage with Spanish speakers in different types of libraries. Design/methodology/approach. The article draws on a subset of data from the larger bilingual, self-administered, qualitative survey conducted in two large urban areas (Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and New York City, NY, USA). These data are used to develop a practice framework by translating the generated empirical knowledge into concrete applications that can benefit librarians who engage Spanish speaking readers. Findings. The study analyzes the changed (or unchanged) amount of leisure reading, the various ways of accessing reading materials, alterations and evolution in reading content, and the choice of language preferred for reading different types of leisure materials. Originality. Reader studies, such as this one, are essential for facilitating the practice of reading experience (RE) librarianship in all types of libraries (public, academic, and special,) because they look beyond information needs and programming ideas into the soul of the people in their real-life circumstances, connecting librarians and readers on a deeper humanistic and cultural level. © 2021 The Author(s).

It has been detected that the population at greatest risk is university students along with adolescents. At the same time, Spain is one of the countries with the highest PIU rate. The purposes of this article were to analyze the presence and degree of Internet addiction among university students and to check the sociodemographic factors that influence the PIU. To this end, 13 hypotheses were put forward and contrasted using a structural equation model. The study adopted a cross-sectional approach by applying the Internet addiction test to a sample of undergraduate students in southern Spain (n = 1,013). The results indicated a prevalence of PIU among students of almost 12.5% and with a moderate degree of addiction. In turn, the following hypotheses that had a significant effect on the PIU were supported: gender; field of knowledge; living in the parents’ home; Internet daily use for leisure; Internet daily use for academic purposes; number of social networks; sexual orientation; marital status. Finally, the main findings of the study were reviewed, and the main recommendations and implications for mitigating the negative effects of technology and enhancing the positive ones were established. © The Author(s) 2021.",college students; higher education; human behavior; Internet addiction; problematic Internet use,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Marín-Marín, J.-A.; University of GranadaSpain; email: jmarin@ugr.es",,SAGE Publications Inc.,8944393,,,,English,Soc.

The internet has been called the most well-measured media (Lamas, 2010), but many questions remain unresolved today. The aim of this study is to study the digital audience measurement system in the Spanish environment in order to provide indicators and parameters, as well as the technology used to measure the digital audience in the Spanish market. The current system for measuring digital audiences in Spain is analyzed based on a mixed methodology including statements by experts. The official measuring company, Comscore, bases its work on the census, sampling, and data from other collaborating digital operators. The results of the hybrid methodology provide digital consumption data for Spain. The experts’ opinions indicate that the system is not perfect and presents various deficiencies and challenges. A consolidated and consensual system remains far off, mainly because, since the object of study is in constant transformation due to technical advances, measurement systems must also be adapted to these new needs as well as to improvements in financing. Despite the introduction of new monitoring tech-nologies, the current model barely reflects digital consumption in Spain. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Here, we analyze a historical spatial social network (SSN) of 680 Mafia members found in a 1960 investigatory dossier compiled by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Narcotics. The dossier includes connections between members who were ‘known criminal associates’ and members are geolocated to a known home address across 15 major U.S. cities. Under an overarching narrative of identifying the network’s proclivities toward security (dispersion) or efficiency (ease of coordination), we pose four research questions related to criminal organizations, power and coordination strategies. We find that the Mafia network is distributed as a portfolio of nearby and distant ties with significant spatial clustering among the Mafia family units. The methods used here differ from former methods that analyze the point pattern locations of individuals and the social network of individuals separately.

We examine the social media communication of the three main Italian political leaders during the last national electoral campaign to underline the differences and similarities in their use of populist communication in terms of ideology and style and assess how it affects Facebook and Twitter engagement. Our analysis shows that the three leaders all adopt populist communication styles but in slightly different ways. In all cases, populist style elements have a stronger impact on online engagement than populist ideology. The main difference between social media seems to be related less to the leaders’ communication elements than to their platform-specific audiences’ positive reactions to populist communication strategies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",communication style; engagement; political leader; Populism; social media campaigning,,,This work was supported by the Universit? di Pisa PRA (Athenaeum Research Project) under Grant Populismo in Italia: attori e processi in tempi di crisi (PRA_2018_10).,,,,,,,,,,"Bracciale, R.; Department of Political Science, Italy; email: roberta.bracciale@unipi.it",,Routledge,1369118X,,,,English,Inf.

This strategy consists of putting in place a series of complex and specific actions that bring into play numerous actors, to ensure that users are willing to accept digital channels and that weaker users are not disadvantaged. Although this strategy is being increasingly adopted in various countries, scholars have scarcely begun to explore its logic. This research explores how to define a service delivery strategy that forces users to adopt digital channels. Four in-depth case studies have been conducted on Italian local governments that started delivering their non-educational school services through digital channels alone. We found that a mandatory service delivery strategy is feasible when the starting point is to understand the users' characteristics, skills and behaviours and, as a consequence, whether they perceive the service as complex and/or ambiguous. With this in mind, public organisations can select the proper mix of channels for each category of users and combine their change in approach with behavioural-type interventions, i.e. by creating the right conditions to modify the users' behaviour. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Channel choice; Digital public service; Local governments; Mandatory digital channel; Media richness theory; Multichannel management,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tangi, L.email: luca.tangi@polimi.it",,Elsevier Ltd,0740624X,,GIQUE,,English,Gov.

The data studied emerged from the Transmedia Literacy project (European Commission-Horizon 2020) which involved eight countries from three continents. Through the analysis of information gathered with multiple methodologies (survey, in-depth interviews, workshops and media diaries), the article explores both the consuming and producing media practices of Italian teenagers and the ways in which they are connected with emerging transmedia skills (Guerrero-Pico, Masanet, & Scolari, 2019; Scolari 2018). The data shows that Italian teenagers may still be considered quite traditional media users: their creative participation is limited and often they merely imitate, or remix others’ works, acting as ‘functional prosumers’ rather than ‘critical prosumers’ (Chen, Wu, & Wang, 2011). The outcome of the research reveals teenagers’ meta-reflexive approach to media, an approach that seems to regulate and restrict their attitude towards creating and, above all, exposing their own creativity online. At the same time, teens demonstrate the acquisition of new and creative skills related, in particular, to the mechanisms of media industry and self-management. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",creativity; media skills; participation; teens; Transmedia; web 2.0,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 645238; Horizon 2020",This work was supported by Horizon 2020?

The first work written in the topic is Maretić's history of orthography (Maretić 1889). It is also important to mention the study by Milan Moguš and Josip Vončina (Moguš-vončina 1969), in which they corrected several false statements written by Maretić. Recently, a few more papers on orthographic history have been published (Kapetanovič 2005, Farkaš-Ćurak 2016, Farkaš 2019); nevertheless, it is necessary to point out the work by László Hadrovics, the only researcher in the subject who paid great attention to the dual tradition of the Latin-script orthography in the Croatian language. Following the steps of Hadrovics, the main goal of this paper is to present which cultural historical reasons determined the development of the dual tradition of the Croatian Latin-script orthography as well as to introduce the use of graphemes in detail. The church played an important role in the development of the Latin script. During the Middle Ages, the church counted as the centre of the literacy, thus it is obvious that the ecclesiastical Latin pronunciation defined the evolution of the individual national languages' orthographies. From this point of view, the Croatian is a special case, as in the Middle Ages, the Southern Croatian areas were strongly affected by the Italian, more precisely by the Venetian language, while in the northern areas, overlapping the Archdiocese of Zagreb, a strong Hungarian impact can be observed. The southern orthographic tradition follows the Italian pronunciation, i.e. the spelling is also based on the current Italian orthography. Nevertheless, in the northern areas, the Latin /s/ phoneme is pronounced in a Hungarian way, as [∫] or [3]. The two orthographic systems were in use side by side over the centuries; nonetheless, since the end of the 16th century, there were several attempts to create a ""mixed""system, which was successfully carried out only in the 18th-century Slavonian orthography. © 2021 The Author.",dual tradition; historical overview; Hungarian influence; Hungarian orthography; Italian influence; Italian orthography; Latin-script orthography; orthography; the Croatian language; the use of graphemes,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dudás, E.; Department of Slavic Studies, Múzeum krt. 4/D., Hungary; email: dudas.elod@btk.elte.hu",,Akademiai Kiado ZRt.,393363,,,,Croatian,Stud.

Design/methodology/approach: DEMATEL and BWM methods are used to determine weights of the criteria that are defined for the supplier selection problem.

The validity of the results is checked using comparison with other decision-making methods and several performance analysis tests. Practical implications: The proposed multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model contributes to the healthcare supply chain management (SCM) and aims to lead the policy makers in selecting the best supplier.

These new attitudes haven’t been systematically studied. We explore here the links between milk/dairy consumption, health concerns, and trust in medical expertise. Through an online survey of highly educated youth in Italy (N=378) we have investigated: milk and dairy consumption; attitudes towards items carried out by vegan movements; attitudes towards medical expertise and trust in counseling by general practitioners. Results show that anti-speciesist and vegan movements are very little known among consumers. Data display very limited impact of the ideas and concepts of anti-milk movements within our sample. The results highlight that milk consumption shrinking is due to health concern and an unfavorable perception of dangerous consequences in lactose intake, and additionally to a general distrust towards medical expertise and evidence-based arguments. Indeed, we observe a tendency to self-diagnose intolerance/allergies, questioning the role of physicians and medical knowledge in advising for dietary choices among highly educated youth. The analysis of the patterns of consumption and motives clearly shows that health considerations, not politics, are behind the Italian youth’s dairy restrictions.

Special attention will be paid to the annotations that appear in the margins of the documents, since they bring light to the activities that were taken over by a wide array of the Consejo’s officials in order to treat the information that came from America. We will demonstrate that such activities—classifying, summarizing, but also linking documents to one another across time and space—were at the core of the process of decision-making in the Spanish monarchy. The main challenge of this research, however, is that most of the marginal annotations were anonymous, and that not all of them were written by the same person, nor did they have the same functions. In order to overcome those obstacles, we will combine a visual, paleographic, and textual study of the sources aimed at exploring the links between the overseas reports, the marginal annotations and the royal decrees to which they had given rise. In doing so, we will highlight the paradoxical nature of the archive which, through its classifying process, gives access to a wide range of documents and, at the same time, separates them from one another and even tends to erase the connections that used to exist between them. Examining the margins of the documents will thus enable us to better understand the relationship between archival techniques, political communication and the development of imperial legality in the Spanish monarchy. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Archival technologies; Legality; Marginal comments; Political communication; Spanish empire,,Harvard University,"A preliminary version of this article was presented at the Half-Day Symposium ?What is a Legal Archive?? organized by Kalyani Ramnath at the Center for History and Economics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, 21 November 2019.

Design/methodology/approach: The Times Higher Education World University Rankings was used to identify the top ten universities from each of the US and Canada, as well as the top 20 Spanish-language universities in Latin America. Each university library's website was scrutinized to discover whether the libraries employed scholarly communication librarians, whether they offered scholarly communication workshops, or whether they shared information about scholarly communication on their websites. This information was further examined to determine if it discussed predatory publishing specifically. Findings: Most libraries in the US/Canada sample employ scholarly communication librarians and nearly half offer workshops on predatory publishing. No library in the Latin America sample employed a scholarly communication specialist and just one offered a workshop addressing predatory publishing. The websites of the libraries in the US and Canada addressed predatory publishing both indirectly and directly, with US libraries favoring the former approach and Canadian libraries tending towards the latter. Predatory publishing was rarely addressed directly by the libraries in the Latin America sample; however, all discussed self-archiving and/or Open Access. Research limitations/implications: Brazilian universities were excluded owing to the researchers' language limitations. Data were collected between September 15 and 30, 2019, so it represents a snapshot of information available at that time. The study was limited to an analysis of library websites using a fixed set of keywords, and it did not investigate whether other campus units were involved or whether other methods of informing researchers about predatory publishing were being used. Originality/value: The study reveals some best practices leading to recommendations to help academic libraries combat predatory publishing and improve scholarly publishing literacy among researchers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Academic libraries; Canada; Latin America; Predatory publishing; United States,Publishing; Websites; Academic libraries; Design/methodology/approach; Higher education; Scholarly communication; Scholarly publishing; Shared information; Spanish language; University libraries; Libraries,,This work is supported by the matching funds program of the University of Ottawa's PhD program in Digital Transformation and Innovation.,,,,,,,,,,"Bowker, L.; School of Information Studies, Canada; email: lbowker@uottawa.ca",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,20503806,,,,English,Aslib J.

For this purpose, a model with two dimensions (impact and visibility) based on quantitative criteria has been carried out. To obtain indicators in each of these dimensions, databases such as the Science Citation Index, the Social Science Citation Index, the Arts & Humanities Citation Index and the Emerging Sources Citation Index from the Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, SciELO, Google Metrics and the Information Matrix for the Analysis of Journals are used as sources of information.

However, not only is the institutional strategic planning of HEIs still understudied, as the individual perceptions of faculty members about existing constraints to digital innovation have been particularly overlooked. This article examines Portuguese universities and polytechnic institutes, the two components of the national higher education system, to (1) characterize the quality of the available digital infrastructure and resources (hardware and software) and (2) identify the main constraints to digital innovation. The study conducts the most comprehensive online questionnaire available to date on these topics across Portuguese HEIs (N = 547). The main constraints to digital innovation correspond to limited infrastructure and resources, lack of funding opportunities, insufficient technological resources, a conservative academic culture, and a lack of technical support.

The main purposes are to determine whether certain Latin American Spanish-language independent publishers function as gatekeepers of world literature and to analyze the geopolitical structure of this global market, addressing both the Europe-America dialectic and neocolonial practices. Design/methodology/approach: After selecting the sample of publishers, the authors conducted a search for their Twitter profiles and located 131; they then downloaded data from the corresponding Twitter APIs. Finally, they applied social network analysis to study the presence of and interaction between the sample of independent publishers on this social media. Findings: The results provide data-based evidence supporting the hypothesis of some literary critics who suggest that in Latin America, certain publishers act as gatekeepers to the mainstream book market. Therefore, Twitter could be considered a valid source of information to address the independent book market in Spanish.

Given the importance of such a diversity of materials (music manuscripts, recordings, resources in electronic formats, printouts, etc.), in 2015 the Central National Bibliographic Agency (Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo Unico ICCU) gave its group of music experts the task of producing specific cataloguing rules. The cooperation of professionals from different backgrounds and careers in the working group has been fundamental to achieving this goal: the rules are expected to fit any kind of non-published music resource, from electronic formats to old music manuscripts, from handwritten music to printouts and all kinds of video and sound recordings and files. The rules are based on the most recent conceptual models (IFLA-LRM, ICA, RiC-CM), on the provisions of REICAT the National Cataloguing Rules and anticipate the extension of ISBD to non-published resources, as decided in 2012. The elaboration of rules suitable for several contexts, serving both bibliographical and archival descriptions, was a great challenge with the aim to share all the information without affecting the nature of the collections.

Italy’s most recently completed evaluation effort (VQR 2011–14) required each university to submit to the Ministry for Education, University, and Research (MIUR) 2 research products per author (3 in the case of other research institutions), chosen in such a way that the same product is not assigned to two authors belonging to the same institution. This constraint suggests that larger institutions, where collaborations among colleagues may be more frequent, could suffer a size-related bias in their evaluation scores. To validate our claim, we investigate the outcome of artificially splitting Sapienza University of Rome, one of the largest universities in Europe, in a number of separate partitions, according to several criteria, noting significant score increases for several partitioning scenarios. © 2020, The Author(s).",Bibliometrics; Graph partitioning; National evaluations; Research assessment,,Sapienza Università di Roma,Open access funding provided by Universit? degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.,,,,,,,,,,"Schaerf, M.; Department of Computer, Via Ariosto 25, Italy; email: marco.schaerf@uniroma1.it",,Springer Netherlands,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089107775

The new regulatory framework emphasised the role of the evaluation process carried out by the designated audit authorities (OIV or NDV); legislators provided a new information system principally making accessible the audit-related data and other information via the institutional websites of Italian cities. In this context, the Minister of Public Administration promoted the platform called ‘Bussola della Trasparenza’, the goal of which is to ensure easy access to institutional data of the municipalities and to evaluate the available information. However, we found that the results provided by this platform were unreliable. Our study of 525 municipalities showed severe discrepancies with Bussola's evaluation, suggesting a lack of transparency. We therefore propose a logit model as an alternative framework to evaluate the probability that a municipal website is compliant with the new regulations using a set of predictors to consider a broader and more complete definition of transparency. This model is thought to be a practical tool to correctly evaluate the compliance of municipal websites. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Audit authorities; E-government; Information quality; Quantitative methods in economics and law; Transparency,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pernagallo, G.; Collegio Carlo Alberto, Piazza Vincenzo Arbarello 8, Italy; email: giuseppe.pernagallo@carloalberto.org",,Elsevier Ltd,0740624X,,GIQUE,,English,Gov.

Several studies reveal that collaboration can be strongly influenced by knowledge sharing. The literature suggests that this topic is quite relevant and that there is an evident lack of empirical studies that properly investigate the relationship between knowledge-sharing and collaborative behaviour in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). In this context, the purpose of this work is to examine whether knowledge-sharing intention has a positive relationship with collaborative behaviour among professors and researchers in a public Portuguese HEI, taking into account other constructs that can have effect on the knowledge-sharing intention. In order to reach this objective, a conceptual research model was developed based on the theory of reasoned action. The empirical study was conducted based on a questionnaire, and the data analysis was performed using partial least squares. The results indicate that intrinsic motivation and networking are the factors that positively affect the attitude towards knowledge sharing. Nevertheless, it is concluded that trust is the variable that more strongly affects the knowledge-sharing intention. Finally, the study identified that knowledge-sharing intention has a positive influence in collaborative behaviour. It is considered that this study can contribute to support institutions’ management in defining strategies and developing actions in order to promote an organisational culture based on knowledge management that significantly leads to knowledge-sharing and collaboration relationships. © The Author(s) 2019.",Collaborative behaviour; higher education institutions; knowledge sharing; partial least squares; theory of reasoned action,Least squares approximations; Collaborative behaviour; Higher education institutions; Knowledge-sharing; Partial least square (PLS); Theory of reasoned action; Knowledge management,"Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT; Center for Research and Development in Mathematics and Applications, CIDMA: UID/CEC/00127/2019, UID/MAT/04106/2019","This work was supported by Funda??o para a Ci?ncia e a Tecnologia (FCT), through CIDMA within project UID/MAT/04106/2019 and through IEETA in the context of the project UID/CEC/00127/2019.

By looking at publications indexed in Scopus, we detected research communities among Italian sociologists. We found that Italian sociologists are fractured in many disconnected groups. The giant connected component could be split into five main groups with a mix of three main disciplinary topics: sociology of culture and communication (present in two groups), economic sociology (present in three groups) and general sociology (present in three groups). By applying an exponential random graph model, we found that collaboration ties are mainly driven by the research interests of these groups.

The reference librarians often are restricted to directing the students and scholars to the secondary resources that are available both in print and as a part of the digital assets within the North American academic libraries. This paper aims to focus on the select primary source editions including select Spanish language colonial imprints that are available electronically on the Web along the Open Access. These Web-based resources serve as the reference tools for the early history of the Philippines and Southeast Asia. As many of these publications are rare and extremely expensive for most libraries, the Open Access resources serve as an aid to building a virtual collection of these items. Design/methodology/approach: The author had to create a data set of the early imprints of the Spanish Philippines using several bibliographic resources. The data set will be submitted as an Appendix for this research paper. The author did both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data set along with the voyant-based digital humanities approach for topic modeling. Findings: The goals of this paper were to not only survey the early Spanish printing of the Philippines but also provide the reader with a somewhat complete picture of how the printing began in the Spanish Philippines, what kind of the first books were printed and how one can access them given their rarity and fragility. The collection building paradigms are undergoing significant shifts, and the focus of many academic libraries is shifting toward providing access to these items. As these items high-value low-use items continue to be part of the Special Collections, the access to these is problematic. The virtual collections thus serve as a viable alternative that enables further research and access. While the creators of these works are long gone, the legacy of the Spanish colonial domination, printing and the religious orders in the Philippines remain alive through these works. Research limitations/implications: As this is an introductory paper, the author focused on the critical editions rather than providing a comprehensive bibliographic landscape of the presses that produced these editions. He also did not take into consideration many pamphlets that were published in the same period. He also did not consider the Chinese language publications of the Islands. The Chinese had been block printing since medieval times (Little, 1996). In the context of the Spanish Philippines, the Chinese migration and trade have been studied in detail by Chia (2006), Bjork (1998) and Gebhardt (2017). The scope of this paper also was centered toward building a virtual collection of these rare books. Practical implications: Rare books are often expensive and out-of-reach for many libraries; the virtual collection of the same along the Open Access model represents an alternative to collect and curate these collections. The stewardship of these collections also acquires a new meaning in the digital milieu. Social implications: This research paper will allow scholars to see past the analog editions and help them focus on curating a virtual collection. The questions of electronic access are often ignored when it comes to visiting and using them in a controlled environment of the reading room in the Special Collections. The author argues that one way to enable access to these rare and expensive books is to provide access to their digital counterparts. These digital/virtual surrogates of the originals will facilitate further research.

Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach is applied to the analysis of this agency gap in work-family balance (WFB). Males wishing to balance work and family face a series of barriers that inhibit their use of FFM, creating a gap between the theoretical right to use these measures and the real ability to do so. We illustrate this broader issue with qualitative information collected from a Spanish sample (59 semi-structured interviews with 43 salaried fathers, 6 salaried mothers and 10 human resources (HR) managers). Three types of factors (conversion factors) that enhance/limit the capabilities of fathers to use reconciliation measures were considered: individual factors, policy and societal factors, and factors related to the organizational culture of workplaces. © The Author(s) 2020.",capability; capabilité; entitlement; family-friendly measures; father involvement; implication du père; mesures favorables à la famille; sentiment d’ayant droit; work-family balance; équilibre travail-famille,,Spanish National Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation: RTI2018-094901-B-I00,This research was funded by the Spanish National Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation (ref: RTI2018-094901-B-I00).,,,,,,,,,,"Fernández-Cornejo, J.A.; Complutense University of MadridSpain; email: joaferna@ucm.es",,SAGE Publications Ltd,5390184,,,,English,Soc.

Besides making available this database for research, our contribution is three-fold: First, we employ a variety of mood induction procedures, whose combinations are especially tailored for specific emotions.Second, we use combinations of selection procedures such as an alexithymia test and self- and external assessment, obtaining 1,5 k (proto-) typical samples; these were used in a perception test (86 native Italian subjects, categorical identification and dimensional rating). Third, machine learning techniques—based on standardised brute-forced openSMILE ComParE features and support vector machine classifiers—were applied to assess how emotional typicality and sample size might impact machine learning efficiency.Our results are three-fold as well: First, we show that appropriate induction techniques ensure the collection of valid samples, whereas the type of self-assessment employed turned out not to be a meaningful measurement. Second, emotional typicality—which shows up in an acoustic analysis of prosodic main features—in contrast to sample size is not an essential feature for successfully training machine learning models.

The last paragraph in page 9 shoud read as below, To answer the first research question about whether the coordinated networks identified through the method described above actually spread problematic content online, we checked the domains they shared against blacklists of already identified sources of “fake” and hyperpartisan news. The list of problematic websites was retrieved from Italian established debunking websites (butac.it, bufale.net, bufalopedia.it and pagellapolitica.it). The first three sources have been previously used to identify and measure Italian problematic information (Fletcher et al., 2018), while pagellapolitica.it is Facebook’s Italian official fact-checking partner. Merging these blacklists we ended up with a list of 376 problematic news domains (see Appendix 1). Moreover, we checked the coordinated entities against a list of 87 Facebook pages already pointed out as sources of problematic information by the nonprofit organization Avaaz (Di Benedetto Montaccini, 2019; Mastinu, 2019), whose investigative reports have already spotlighted numerous disinformation networks that Facebook subsequently took down (see Appendix 2). Risk Ratio (RR)1 was used to calculate statistically significant differences in proportions of problematic domains shared by coordinated and non-coordinated networks, as well as in the prevalence of problematic Facebook entities.

Most of these attempts focus on false content and/or bad actors detection. In this paper, we argue for a wider ecological focus. Using the frame of media manipulation and a revised version of the ‘coordinated inauthentic behavior’ original definition, the paper presents a study based on an unprecedented combination of Facebook data, accessed through the CrowdTangle API, and two datasets of Italian political news stories published in the run-up to the 2018 Italian general election and 2019 European election. By focusing on actors’ collective behavior, we identified several networks of pages, groups, and verified public profiles (‘entities’), that shared the same political news articles on Facebook within a very short period of time. Some entities in our networks were openly political, while others, despite sharing political content too, deceptively presented themselves as entertainment venues. The proportion of inauthentic entities in a network affects the wideness of the range of news media sources they shared, thus pointing to different strategies and possible motivations. The paper has both theoretical and empirical implications: it frames the concept of ‘coordinated inauthentic behavior’ in existing literature, introduces a method to detect coordinated link sharing behavior and points out different strategies and methods employed by networks of actors willing to manipulate the media and public opinion. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",coordinated inauthentic behavior; disinformation; elections; Facebook; Media manipulation; problematic information,,"Social Science Research Council, SSRC: SSRC-030",This work was supported by Social Science Research Council [Grant number: SSRC-030].,,,,,,,,,,"Giglietto, F.; Department of Communication Sciences, Italy; email: fabio.giglietto@uniurb.it",,Routledge,1369118X,,,,English,Inf.

This phenomenon, called polarization, is also present in public debate on social networks and has generated a significant number of studies and empirical research. In this context, a few noteworthy factors in the study of polarization are the concepts of ‘homophily’ and ‘homogeneity’. These terms refer to the fragmenting effect of social networks and are the consequence of the common characteristics and attributes of the members that comprise them. In this work, we analyze this phenomenon in relation with the General Elections for the Presidency of Spain and, particularly, in the case of the candidature of the political party UnidosPodemos. We used data from the Twitter social network to analyze the subjects of debate, and the affective positions in relation with each of these. We found that the most active political agents had postures that were clearly homogenized in affective terms.

The model is based on Linked Open Data technology and seeks to exhaustively represent the most relevant characteristics for the tasks of contextualization of the documentary groupings and units, management, document retrieval, dissemination and sharing of data about the historical photographs. Design/methodology/approach: An OWL ontology, called Ontophoto, was constructed following an adaptation of the methodology proposed by Uschold and Gruninger and Gruninger and Fox. The ontology was implemented using Protégé 5.5 software. Next a Graph DB® graph database application (Ontotext) was created to generate a query system based on the SPARQL language. To validate the consistency and effectiveness of the model and ontology, a competency questions methodology has been applied using a sample from the Skogler photographic archive. Findings: The model facilitates the generation of systems for dissemination and retrieval of iconographic data for historical research, overcoming some of the limitations with respect to the design of methods of content and contextual information representation for heritage photographic archives. Research limitations/implications: This study is based on a sample. Future work should consider the implementation of the model on the totality of a photographic collection.

At the same time, it contributes to overcoming some of the limitations with respect to the design of methods of content and contextual information representation, which are necessarily based on linguistic text and the root cause of many of the graphic content retrieval problems in many image retrieval systems for heritage photographic archives. This reality results in significant imbalances that are, to a great extent, hindering the use of this type of source by historians, as has been noted by Harris and Hepburn (2013) . The limitations are compounded if we do not consider our proposed main objective, which is to provide full support for the investigation processes inherent in iconographic research, with multiple possibilities for generalization, specialization and interrelation of the concepts present in the content of the photographs or in their thematic, production and legal contexts. There are many obstacles to be overcome in the process of designing this type of model, given the complexity of modeling and giving ontological shape to the richness of meanings that can be derived from the content of the photographic images and to the knowledge directly or indirectly related to this content and to the production context of the photographic archives themselves and their photographs. In an effort to overcome these obstacles, we have drawn on numerous earlier proposals for image representation models applicable to ontologies and schemas for representing graphic content or other types of entities that we have considered in our model. We have also incorporated a large number of our own solutions in order to design an ontology model and a series of formalized coding standards for representations of all the relevant entity types for the proposed purpose. The Ontophoto ontology model has been designed for maximum compatibility with the schemas that are most frequently used to generate LOD information systems in the field of cultural heritage. We also tried to take advantage of the classes and properties of these schemes that have equivalence with those defined in the model. Therefore, mapping processes with standardized or widely used schemas that are more general (and less complex regarding to the structures of representations of documents or works of art) can be performed and represented in the ontology itself with relative simplicity.

Given that multiplicity of channels does not imply a superior offer of contents or media plurality, it is necessary to analyze the content of each channel to determine which contents have increased its presence on television, as well as which ones have been gradually replaced. In addition, we will interview twenty film critics, television presenters, journalist and program directors on this matter. Conclusions: Film shows have increasingly reached lower levels of representation on generalist public and private channels. In this context it is eloquent the existence of one channel into the Spanish public service broadcaster (RTVE), La 2 de Televisión Española, that broadcasts a wide range of film review television shows. © 2020 Departamento de Periodismo I de la Universidad de Sevilla..

But what do Spanish journalists talk about on Twitter? The research is characterized by its descriptive and analytical aim, and its quantitative and qualitative approach. The work presents a retrospective longitudinal investigation that studied a diachronic succession of messages via Twitter produced over a certain period. The study, with a sampling work of one and a half years, designed a categorization system of registration units that were subsequently quantified. The study corpus consisted of 3,500 tweets issued by 20 journalists who were Twitter account holders in seven days over seven weeks, between January 2017 and March 2018, and by 35 newspaper covers that were published in that same period. The sources of the data obtained from the monitoring of the two groups of journalists were structured into two invited and non-probability samples. Based on this, the research analyzes the tweets of Spanish journalists classified into five thematic categories: politics, culture, science, communication, and the Internet. The study has created a unit classification system made up of 35 thematic categories and 1,226 subcategories. The research concludes, among other aspects, that through Twitter journalists offer a thematic scope much more extensive than the mass media. Hispano-America is presented as a stage for political debate against Europe; while crises, especially international ones, condition the media thematic agendas. The non-existence of a cultural information strategy and a leading role of self-promotion are detected. © 2020 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

This article offers content analysis results from a selection of eight Spanish think tanks in the digital press during a seven-year period, adding new conclusions to previous literature for the same period. Not only does this research explore the appearance on the media, but also the type of mentions and authorship of the articles and blogs included in the digital press, contributing to a deeper study of think tanks. The objective of this study is to analyse the limited presence of Spanish think tanks in media outlets and whether their appearance is ideologically motivated. The article built a constructed week sampling and followed a content analysis methodology to gather quantitative and qualitative elements from the selected sampling (n=1,101). The paper concludes that the presence of think tanks in the Spanish digital press is limited, causing not only a lack of knowledge of their existence but also raising questions about how they try to impact on the policymaking process. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The projection will be taken from a specific collection: The photographs published in the weekly publication Chronicle (1929-1938) from July to December 1936, coinciding with the first six months of the Spanish Civil War. And we will use a methodology based on three phases: the first one consists of cataloguing individually each of the 931 photographs which covered the pages of the publication during the period of study. The second one is the creation of percentage profiles based on the quantitative results with the intention of discovering a trend. The third phase is the interpretation of this result with the intention of recording those camouflaged performances which allow us to extract information included in the snapshot but which is blurred if we apply a distracted gaze. Therefore, our aim is to launch a curious look on the photographs published in Chronicle between July and December 1936. © 2020, Revista General de Informacion y Documentacion.

Spanish Library and Information Science (LIS) journals have achieved a prominent presence in international databases. By studying the articles published in them, it is possible to determine the thematic evolution of research in LIS, a subject on which few studies are available. The current work presents a bibliometric and thematic analysis of Spanish journals included in the Information Science and Library Science category of the Web of Science between 2015 and 2019. On the one hand, the production of the journals is identified and analyzed individually and as a group, according to the data available in the WoS Core Collection, considering the productivity of authors, citations, organizations, countries, and core publications. On the other hand, the production of journals as a whole is analyzed using SciMAT, an open-source software tool developed to perform science mapping analysis in a longitudinal framework by identifying research themes that have been the object of research during the period of analysis as well as their composition, relationship, and evolution. The results highlight the specialization of Spanish LIS journals in a series of topics that can be grouped into five main areas, in order of impor-tance: social networks and digital media, bibliometrics and scholarly communication, open access, open data and big data, libraries, and information and knowledge management. Likewise, these journals have opened up their thematic focus to other disciplines, among which Communication stands out prominently, as reflected in the established thematic categories. This study establishes a reference framework for researchers in the Information Science and Library Science area, making it possible to understand new relationships and research opportunities both inside and outside the original knowledge area. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

This effect is also driven by television itself, which has begun to strategically introduce participation within the content itself to give prominence to the audience. Television is enjoying a moment of splendor that is full of opportunities for new businesses. It is of great interest to analyze and study the level of interaction and participation of millennial audiences with past political elections, through the study of not only social networks but also other screens, especially television. In this research, the behavior of young Spanish university students regarding television and digital political content is analyzed to determine their preferences and the effectiveness of the content regarding their vote. The main aim is to determine the level of social participation and interaction of these audiences with political messages on networks and television, and whether such behavior affects their voting decisions. To this end, a survey was carried out in various Spanish autonomous communities to confirm whether differences were present. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The objective of this study is to analyze the relations between the institutional communication of research results to the public and the impact and academic visibility of scientific papers. For this purpose, science communication and dissemination undertaken through press releases on R+D+i results from the Science Culture and Innovation Unit (SCIU) at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) were selected as a case study. This SCIU was chosen because it has published yearly reports for more than a decade on the impact in the media of its press releases. Press dossiers of the last five years available (2014-2018) were examined, and a database was created of the citations received by texts published in scientific journals indexed in the Web of Science as well as their mentions on social networks through the company Altmetric.com. After that, this information was statistically analyzed. The main results show that the journal impact index is important for obtaining academic citations or appearing in Twitter conversations. However, the influence of the journal impact factor turns out to be lower when it comes to popularizing scientific publications in the media. Furthermore, the statistical evidence points to the fact that scientific publications disseminated through the SCIU receive proportionally more citations than research that has not been disseminated through the institutional channel. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

To do so, they often have the help of provincial councils, autonomous communities, or the State. Previous studies on compliance with this rule igno-red town councils with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, i.e., more than 90% of them. This paper presents an introductory analysis on the presence of transparency information on websites and transparency portals offered by municipalities of all populations. A sample of municipalities, divided into 14 population ranges, was studied, covering 20-30% of munici-palities, extracted proportionally and randomly for each range and from each province. The analysis includes variables such as the existence of a municipal website and specific transparency portal, the connection and publicity between the two, and the minimum presence of information within such portals. Despite support from larger institutions, one out of six municipalities did not have a website, and half of the municipalities did not offer real information on transparency. The three main causes identified (in order) are that their transparency portals are empty, that they do not actively adver-tise their portal on the website, or to a lesser extent (one in ten) that they do not have a transparency portal. This result occurs mostly for municipalities with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants. The municipalities that do offer transparency information mainly use tools provided by the State, which are associated with an electronic site. Efforts by other (autono-mous or provincial) institutions to promote transparency are also detected, although only massively in some provinces. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

We observed the presence of terms related to the pandemic, identifying the kind of information transmitted since the coronavirus disease began, in all broadcasts from La 1, Antena 3, Tele 5, and La sexta channels. The data were taken on alternate days (Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays), with a total review of 31 days, ranging from 1 January to 13 March 2020, when confinement began throughout Spain. This information was compared with the results of general searches and news searches made by Spanish users, to check whether the data were different or ran in parallel with the television data. The conversation about the coronavirus on television clearly changed during the week when confinement was introduced in some areas of Italy. This indicates that the consequences of the pandemic were not anticipated until its effects were already visible. The results also indicate that there was hardly any significant variation in the focus of the programs broadcast by each of the channels. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Television advertising of ACA health plans has directed many consumers to application assistance and enrollment, but little is known about how ads targeted Latinx consumers. We used Kantar Media/CMAG data from the Wesleyan Media Project to assess Spanish- vs. English-language ad targeting strategies and to assess which enrollment assistance resources (in person/telephone vs. online) were emphasized across three Open Enrollment Periods (OEP) (2013–14, 2014–15, 2015–16). We examined differences in advertisement sponsorship and volume of Spanish- versus English-language ads across the three OEPs. State-based Marketplaces sponsored 47% of Spanish-language airings; insurance companies sponsored 55% of English-language airings. The proportion of Spanish-language airings increased over time (8.8% in OEP1, 11.1% in OEP2, 12.0% in OEP3, p <.001). Spanish-language airings had 49% lower (95%CI: 0.50,0.53) and 2.20 times higher odds (95%CI: 2.17,2.24) of mentioning online and telephone/in-person enrollment assistance resources, respectively. While there was a significant decrease in mention of telephone/in-person assistance over time for English-language airings, these mentions increased significantly in Spanish-language airings.

However, unlike in the past with newspapers, this new digital press currently plays little role in universities. To determine the causes of this low prominence of digital newspapers in university libraries, we study the presence of the ten most widely read digital native newspapers in Spain (El español, El confidencial, Ok diario, Economía digital, Eldiario.es, Huffington post, Periodista digital, Publico.es, Vozpópuli, and Libertad digital) according to the reference metrics of the Comscore digital audiences in the 260 educational centers included in the Web Ranking of Universities produced by the Cybermetrics Lab of the Institute of Public Goods and Policies (IPP) of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). The results show that only seven universities (Autonomous University of Barcelona, University of Granada, University of Seville, University of the Basque Country, Carlos III University of Madrid, Camilo José Cela University, and Pontifical University of Salamanca) provide professors and students with access to current and retrospective content of all these media practically since their foundation.

The coverage gravitated around two main themes: the 4N electoral debate, and campaign events. The results reveal that, although most of the tweets had a neutral tone, messages with clear positioning corresponding to the editorial line of the newspaper were also published, albeit to a lesser extent. During the electoral period, the media agenda revolved around this issue, accounting for around one-fifth of all pieces published on Twitter.

The methodology used is qualitative, being based on the application of two techniques: discussion groups carried out with experienced faculty from three Spanish universities, and interviews carried out with the same sample after the suspension of face-to-face teaching. The results show that the faculty members participating in this study have a critical vision of the information and digital competence of the student body, indicating that they lack capacity for evaluation, critical use, and communication of information despite their mastery of technological tools and extensive use of mobile devices. In addition, they doubt their own ability to train students in this competence, and attribute the di-fficulty in achieving and promoting such learning to various factors of the university culture: a lack of coordination among teaching staff, who are sometimes in situations of job insecurity, or the way in which the European Higher Education Area has been applied in universities. Faculty recognize the basic and transversal nature of this competence and advocate its incorporation into the real work methodology of all subjects, not in a segregated way. Finally, the effort made towards the “virtual” development of teaching as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic has been a shock for faculty, who declare a positive attitude towards reviewing their own digital-informative practices to adapt their teaching, but believe that this has hardly resulted in any improvement in the information and digital competence of their students so far. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The reasons for their departure to other countries lie in the deficiencies of the Spanish university system. Drawing from the concepts of habitus (Pierre Bourdieu) and autopoiesis (Niklas Luhmann), 13 semistructured interviews were conducted with researchers chosen by snowball sampling. The informants highlight faculty hiring mechanisms, which in their view have not improved significantly even after the introduction of an accreditation system in 2008. The results also show the poor image of Spanish Communication research abroad, as it is regarded as disconnected from the international trends in the field. The improvements identified by the consulted sample indicate a slow but steady incorporation of Spanish research into the international sphere. However, this is insufficient, in the opinion of the interviewees, to stimulate a possible return of emigrated talent to Spanish higher education institutions. Insufficient and intermittent research funding is one of the most relevant roadblocks. Convergence with the systems leading the world’s scientific production today is still perceived as an unlikely and remote scenario. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Three phenomena related to academic careers in Communication are studied: first, the distribution of positions by category, sex, and years; second, promotion paths; third, the flows between universities, which show a phenomenon of endogamy. To this end, we identified the appointments of professors and associate professors in the areas of Journalism and Audiovisual Communication and Advertising in the Boletín oficial del Estado (the Spanish official gazette). Our analysis provides an understanding of the role of universities as institutions that hire and train faculty, and the flow of faculty among them. The results show that the recruitment of professors and associate professors in the 20 years studied is irregular in terms of distribution, parity, and allocation of positions over time. In turn, successive legislation has generated a system that reduces faculty mobility and favors endogamy. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The research variables of study are: author’s profiles, geographic location, gender, home university, most commonly studied topics, and conside-red media. The results confirm that the gender divide no longer exist: in fact, there are more female than male authors. Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona exhibit the highest rates of participation, and Madrid and Catalonia are the most active regions, followed by Andalusia and Valencia. The topics treated are quite diverse, with the study of media content standing out, mainly those focused on political communication. Other common topics are the impact of the digital age, and audiovisual media structure. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

To this end, relevant bibliographic references were retrieved from the Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA) database, and their titles and abstracts were treated using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method, a statistical thematic modeling technique. Nineteen thematic sets were found and analyzed, labeled, and systematized in four main areas: processes, information technologies, libraries, and specialized documentations. Next, the results in Spanish were compared with international results obtained previously using the same methodology. In conclusion, LIS literature in Spanish mainly follows the international trends: during the last 50 years, the thematic focus of research has shifted from libraries and informational organizations to users and the development of specific systems and solutions. However, LIS research in Spanish also presents distinct characteristics: the importance of bibliometric research and biomedical docu-mentation; research in the library area; and a certain delay in addressing technological, legal, and educational aspects. Although the selection of LISA articles depends on editorial decisions, the application of LDA to the peer-reviewed literature in Spanish provided results that are consistent with the international global trends, studies on other similar sources, and overall the state of the art. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

In a few weeks, the couple travelled throughout the loyal territory to take powerful photographs and document republican victories. Their stay in Toledo is one of the least known. In the city, Colonel Moscardo, along with a group of cadets and civil guards who had supported the military uprising, resisted inside the Alcazar from July 22nd. In the archives of the Magnum Agency and the International Center of Photography, several erroneously catalogued photographs taken by Capa and Taro during their stay in Toledo are kept, with incorrect dates and locations. This first stage as reporters in Spain has been much researched due to the famous photograph Death of a Militiaman, but no data has been provided prior to the work done by the reporters during the siege of the Alcazar. It is an objective of study in this investigation to analyse the images have been identified as Toledo, which is possible thanks to certain details that appear in the snapshots and allow us to recognize the urban spaces and approximate dates. Among the images consulted we can make a distinction between the first trip of the reporters at the end of August and the second trip on September 18th, in addition to a differentiation in the formats of the photographic film used by Capa and Taro. Finally, the role of the German reporter is valued, she started as a photojournalist at this stage and has been forgotten after having been the main protagonist in the life and trajectory of the name of Robert Capa. The photographs added in this research show that the reporters shared their cameras and this point allows us to open a new field of investigation to differentiate between Capa and Taro's work. © 2020 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.",Alcazar; Gerda taro; Photography; Photojournalism; Robert capa; Spanish civil war; Toledo,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hidalgo, C.V.; Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain; email: carvega@ucm.es",,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,11321873,,,,Spanish,Rev.

However, in many organizations, it continues to be linked to human resources departments, based on the understanding that it is linked to the relationship with workers. In this context, characterized by the tendency to promote the experience of employees in order to increase their involvement and enable management change, the concepts of staff happiness and well-being have been introduced into organizations. This work delves into the relationship between internal communication and the happiness and well-being of employees using a questionnaire completed by internal communication managers in 82 Spanish companies that have been recognized for their actions in this area by the Great Place to Work consultancy firm and by the Internal Communication Observatory. The results indicate that the link between happiness and internal communication is strong, despite the fact that happiness management is implemented very little in Spanish organiza tions and in most cases is the responsibility of human resources.

On one hand, the presence of the military, police and civil guards in the media and in the daily press conferences of the Spanish Government’s Coronavirus Crisis Committee and, on the other, tweets by the main political protagonists of the crisis in Spain: the leaders of the five largest national parties (PSOE, PP, Vox, Unidas Podemos and Ciudadanos) and the presidents of four autonomous communities (Catalonia, Madrid, the Valencian Community and the Basque Country) who also pla-yed a particularly important role in managing the crisis. The timeframe covered is from March 15 (start of the state of emergency) to April 25 (final day in which the military and security forces participated in the daily press conferences of the Coronavirus Crisis Committee). The methodology applied involves a qualitative analysis of the appearances by military and security forces in the media and in the press conferences of the aforementioned Committee, which allows us to outline a complex narrative of the events. A content analysis of the Twitter accounts is also performed to show the presence of these groups and the warlike language in their messages. The objectives are to balance the Government’s communication strategy in relation to the presence of the military, the Civil Guard and the National Police: internally (at press conferences) and externally (in the media and, in particular, in speeches by political leaders). © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Within this culture, mobile applications have become a common ground for the meeting between organisations and citizens interested in participating in political matters through the direct experience that these platforms allow. Despite this development, it is difficult to find a complete and reliable taxonomy of apps in the academic or professional literature that analyses how these relationships impact the field of political communication. This study tries to address this gap, introducing the first systematic taxonomy of political communication apps in Spain based on the development of a self-produced taxonomical model that gathers in detail all the variables required to understand the nature of these applications that are available for any smartphone. This rigorous taxonomy comprises political communication applications available at the main app stores (about 316 found in Play Store and App Store). Specifically, the methodological classification was elaborated based on the following categories: promoter agent, app objective, level of interaction, level of autonomy and predominant tone. A very complete picture was obtained from the empirical analysis, which defines and explains the landscape of political communication applications for mobile devices in Spain. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Plan S has been promoted by Science Europe, a group of public research funding agencies through the cOAlition S, and has published two versions that have generated intense academic debate worldwide. Even though no public or private research agency of Spain has been committed at the moment to support Plan S, it is interesting to assess how this Plan can affect the ecosystem of Spanish scientific journals. We present the results of the analysis of the Spanish journals of SCImago Journal Rank in Social Sciences and the compliance that they have with the requirements that cOAlition S has described for the journals to be considered of Open Access of quality. These requirements are related to the opening of the content, the payment model, technical aspects and copyright. It is concluded that although most journals meet the requirements related to open content, they are left with challenges related to the technical aspects of maximum interoperability and reuse.

This article presents an inventory of female Argentine and Spanish directors, as well as their films, from 2000 to 2010, a period marked by the generational change in film industry of both countries and determined by a sociopolitical context democratically consolidated and hampered by economic fluctuations. The objective is twofold: To make women filmmakers visible and to assess their meeting points and divergences. As a method, we chose a descriptive design, applying both a quantitative and qualitative comparative analysis. We conducted a compilation, synthesis, and correlation of works and themes, reaching a corpus of 72 female directors and 138 productions. The results show that there are common issues that reveal the report of unsolved situations for women: Motherhood, female homosociality or ideas about love and sex, the experience or the memory of repression, the structural violence of the authoritarian state and the transformations of the ways of life. There are also differences in terms of times and opportunities, styles and genders, which are typical of the coexistence of diverse but creative film trajectories, all of which are stories that break with limited social models and open up to social commitment. © 2020 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

The aim of this research is to examine, through a content analysis, the defining features of the genre that led this evolution: Comedy. The study includes all the comic fiction of Spanish production released between 1990 and 2018 (180 productions on State networks) and analyses it based on its narrative and stylistic characteristics. The results show that, after a brief period of faithful adaptation to the sitcom, the Spanish television comedy began to develop its own identity. Although it retains some of the defining features of the North American canonical reference, such as stereotypical characters, interior settings and the setting in the contemporary world, it has ignored others, like the average duration of 22 to 24 minutes, the introduction of live or prerecorded laughter and the exclusively episodic structure. In addition, the genre, in its Spanish form, has incorporated new features, such as the shift from the comic to the dramatic, the expansion of the number of plots and main characters, and the introduction of continuity plots and other elements of serialization. Likewise, the Spanish television comedy has integrated an important part of the national theater and film tradition. © 2020 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

The main objective of this work is to analyze the influence of the electoral debates in the publications of the candidates and political parties on Twitter, to find out if they have a greater impact and enhance social discourse. We also aim to determine what type of messages and strategies have greatest impact on Twitter. The methodology used to achieve these goals was a quantitative, qualitative, explanatory and cross-sectional content analysis. To carry it out, a sample composed by 745 tweets was selected from those that reached more than 500 retweets, published by parties (PSOE, PP, Ciudadanos, Unidos Podemos and Vox) and candidates (Pedro Sánchez, Pablo Casado, Albert Rivera, Pablo Iglesias and Santiago Abascal) during the election campaign (21A).The results suggest that televised debates act as true catalysts for social conversation, so the publications made by both, the parties and the candidates themselves, during the television broadcast of these events achieve a greater impact among followers, than those that are not linked to such events. Likewise, it is demonstrated that parties and candidates born in the heyday of social media, get a greater diffusion of their messages, because they have opti-mized their strategies in social networks, something that have not yet been achieved by the formations accustomed to conventional mass media. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

However, this position has recently changed and psychologists and psychiatrists, in addition to the World Health Organization (WHO), request the media to rise awareness about this serious social pro-blem aiming to fight it. Every year, more than 800,000 people commit suicide in the world, which means that one person dies every 40 seconds. Therefore, we depart from a new and apparently agreed upon approach: we must inform. This position being accepted, it is very important to define the limits and the terms. Bibliography on this topic is scarce, only existing one self-regulation reference written by health professionals and journalists in Spain (2018). The aim of this research is to analyze the information on suicide published on the first five months of 2019 by the two main general newspapers in Spain by applying the Code of Ethics on the Treatment of Suicide in the Media promoted by the Association of Journalists of the Balearic Islands. The results show an improvable practice as well as concurring errors remediable to satisfy the demands of organizations, family members and victims by means of responsible and useful journalism. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

For this purpose, an analysis of the content of 21 television series produced in Spain in the second half of 2017 and 2018, of 514 characters (n = 514), has been carried out in order to determine whether there is an unequal representation of male, female and non-binary characters. The main findings indicate that there is an under-representation of women; non-heterosexual sexual orientations are under-represented, as are non-traditional gender identities; women continue to be associated with less qualified professional occupations and, in particular, with domestic work; there is a statistically significant relationship between female characters and less ambitious, more per-sonal work objectives and personalities associated with the world of emotions and motherhood. However, no statistical link was found between gender and narrative weight, gender and hypersexualization, or gender and violence. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

This work studies what type of content they emit on Twitter to establish if the link between these professionals and the mass media or with the cybermedia influences the thematic orientation of their tweet. The study has worked with three samples (a sample of covers of five newspapers of reference of Spain, a sample of ten accounts of Twitter corresponding to journalists from mass communication media and a sample of ten accounts of cyberjournalists). The two-year research has analyzed 3.500 tweets based on a classification system of registration units made up of 35 thematic categories. The study concludes, among other aspects, that politics (national and international) is the great theme of Twitter along with a growing concern for jihadist terrorism and issues of the Ibero-American context over Europe. The work also warns of the existence of thematic gaps in certain areas (such as society, culture, art or science).

Currently, there is a lack of public available genetic datasets incorporating X chromosome genotype data. Although several X chromosome-specific statistics have been developed, there is also a lack of readily available implementations for routine analysis. Here, we aimed: (1) to make public and describe a dataset incorporating phenotype and X chromosome genotype data from a cohort of 915 normal-weight, overweight and obese children, and (2) to deeply describe a whole implementation of the special X chromosome analytic process in genetics. Datasets and pipelines like this are crucial to get familiar with the steps in which X chromosome requires special attention and may raise awareness of the importance of this genomic region. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"child; childhood obesity; female; gene frequency; genetics; genotype; human; male; obesity; phenotype; Spain; X chromosome; Child; Chromosomes, Human, X; Female; Gene Frequency; Genotype; Humans; Male; Overweight; Pediatric Obesity; Phenotype; Spain","Fundación Mapfre; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, ISCIII: IFI17/00048; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF: PI051968, PI1102042, PI1600871, RD12/0026/0015","This paper will be part of Augusto Anguita-Ruiz’s doctorate, which is being completed as part of the “Nutrition and Food Sciences Program” at the University of Granada, Spain.

In this paper we developed a new biodiversity-climate database for Italy, ClimCKmap, based on the critical analysis, quality estimation and subsequent integration of the CKmap database with several high-resolution climate datasets. The original database was quality-checked for errors in toponym, species name and dating; the retained records were georeferenced and their distribution polygonised via Voronoi tessellation. We then integrated the species distribution information with several high-resolution climatic datasets: average monthly minimum and maximum temperature and total monthly precipitation were reconstructed for each Voronoi cell and year. The resulting database contains 268,977 occurrence records from 8,445 binomials and 16,332 localities, dating between 1680 and 2006 CE.

In particular, it focused on the relationship with patrons, since in the service sector users are mostly studied as a cause of stress and rarely considered as a source of support for service operators. Hierarchical regressions carried out on data (167 self-administered questionnaires) showed that burnout dimensions are influenced by some socio-demographic and job characteristics, and by the positive and negative aspects of relationships with users. We present some practical implications for library managers, in order to reduce the impact of their patrons’ negative behaviour and to improve conditions to facilitate the expression of users’ support for workers. © The Author(s) 2018.",Burnout; Job Demands-Resources model; librarians; users’ negative behaviour; users’ support,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Converso, D.; Department of Psychology, Italy; email: daniela.converso@unito.it",,SAGE Publications Ltd,9610006,,,,English,J.

However, since little attention has been given to the impact of GaaP on public value creation more research is needed to analyse whether the GaaP is effective to help the government to deliver public services that fulfil social expectations and, hence, public value. Indeed, efficiency does not guarantee public value. Besides efficiency, public value incorporates citizens' variegated expectations and needs that change over time and that are sometimes rival. For these reasons, the delivery of public value is often challenging for public agencies. The aim of this paper is to explain how the GaaP configuration can help public administration to deliver public value better. The paper finds that the modularity of the platform configuration and different ecosystems that support public agencies need to be orchestrated to support the effective creation of public value. The authors analyse the case of the Italian GaaP initiative to discuss the importance of the orchestration of the GaaP characteristics to improve the coordination among public agencies and enable the co-production of services with external actors, in order to deliver public value better. The findings show that the orchestration of the GaaP configuration characteristics can enable Italian public administration to deliver public value, but also that, if the GaaP is not properly orchestrated, it can constrain the creation of public value. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Ecosystems; GaaP; Orchestration; Public value,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cordella, A.; Department of Management, United Kingdom; email: a.cordella@lse.ac.uk",,Elsevier Ltd,0740624X,,GIQUE,,English,Gov.

Using these markers improves the cohesion and coherence of texts, facilitating reading comprehension. Although often included in tools that support the rhetoric structuring of texts, discourse markers have hardly been explored in writing support tools for learners of a second language. However, learners of a second language, including those at advanced levels, have trouble producing these lexical items, frequently replacing them with items from their native language or with literal translations of items in their own language, which often do not result in proper lexical items in the second language. In addition, students learn a single marker per function and use it repeatedly, producing monotonous texts. With the aim of contributing to reducing these difficulties, this paper presents a lexicon that will be used to support the task of automatically detecting and correcting discourse marker errors. Several heuristics have been evaluated to generate different types of errors. Automatic translation methods were used to semi-automatically compile the lexicon used in these heuristics. Similarity measures were also combined with these heuristics to correct discourse marker errors. The evaluated methods proved to be suitable for the task of identifying some types of discourse marker errors and can potentially identify many others, as long as new lexical inputs are incorporated into them. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Academic writing; Detection/correction of errors; Discourse markers; Native language interference; Writing support tool,,,We thank the Brazilian Science Foundation FAPESP for financial support.

Aromo is a unit selection text-to-speech system, which employs diphones as units of synthesis. The key requirements and design criteria for Emilia were: to synthesize any text in Spanish into high-quality speech with a minimum corpus size. The text corpus was designed to guarantee the phonetic and prosodic coverage. A three-stage strategy was used: in the first stage, 741 sentences were designed with all of the syllables of Spanish spoken in Argentina, with and without stress, and in all positions within the word; in the second stage, 852 sentences were added to balance out the distribution of the diphones; and after a perceptual evaluation of the quality of synthesized speech, in the third and final stage, 625 sentences were added to achieve the specified unit coverage, and to introduce sentences with more complex syntactic and prosodic structures. Issues from all three corpus building stages are reported. The paper also presents the results from the quality perceptual evaluations of the synthesized voice. Emilia has a duration of three hours and 15 minutes; its speech quality synthesized with Aromo system is similar to the level obtained with commercial systems, with a real-time ratio less than one. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Argentine Spanish; Phonetic corpus; Phonetic transcription; Speech corpus design; Text-to-speech,,"Ministerio de Ciencia Tecnología y Telecomunicaciones, MICITT","The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful feedback.

To find information about these enterprises, the authors accessed the General Intervention Board of the State Administration (IGAE) webpage (www.igae.pap.minhafp.gob.es/sitios/igae/es-ES/Paginas/inicio.aspx). This sample was composed of 273 enterprises majority owned and controlled by local governments. Findings: The findings reveal that the amount of information reported by Spanish MOEs, in accordance with the legal requirements, is quite reduced. The most influential variables for explaining Spanish MOEs’ commitment to information disclosure are population size, political positioning of the local government and reputation. Originality/value: This study seeks to contribute to the scarce literature on mandatory transparency in the public sector as well as to reinforce the degree of compliance with requirements of information disclosure. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Disclosure; Institutional; Legitimacy; Municipal-owned enterprises; Stakeholder; Transparency,Population statistics; Websites; Amount of information; Design/methodology/approach; Disclosure; Information disclosure; Institutional; Legitimacy; Stakeholder; State administration; Transparency; article; city; content analysis; government; population size; public sector,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andrades, J.; Department of Accounting and Finance, Spain; email: javier.andrades@uca.es",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,14684527,,OIRNA,,English,Online Info.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper applies a content analysis and a survey. The content analysis was used to analyze the websites of 50 public Spanish universities in the year 2016, while the survey was submitted to all members of the Social Councils of Spanish public universities. Also, a regression analysis (ordinary least square model) is conducted to relate the disclosure index to its determinants. Findings: The results of this study show that human capital was the most disclosed category with relational capital being the least frequently disclosed. However, the quality of structural capital disclosures was higher than relational and human capital. Moreover, the results show that size and university’s internationality affect IC disclosure in Spanish public universities. Practical implications: This paper stimulates the debate between universities and policy-makers concerning the benefits related to IC reporting as a tool for addressing different stakeholders’ needs. In order to satisfy the information needs of university stakeholders, Spanish universities can be recommended to focus on reporting higher quality information on financial relations, students’ satisfaction, quality standard, work-related knowledge/know-how and collaboration between universities and other organizations such as firms, local government and society as a whole. Originality/value: This research brings new expertise regarding IC disclosure in higher education and to reveal some of the possible determinants to improve this disclosure. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Intellectual capital; Quality disclosure; Spain; Universities,Education computing; Integrated circuits; Knowledge management; Least squares approximations; Personnel; Regression analysis; Surveys; Websites; Design/methodology/approach; Intellectual capital; Knowledge/know-how; Ordinary least squares; Public universities; Quality information; Spain; Universities; Economic and social effects; article; content analysis; education; government; human; human experiment; international cooperation; least square analysis; organization; satisfaction; Spain; student,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ramirez, Y.; Department of Business Administration, Spain; email: Yolanda.Ramirez@uclm.es",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,14684527,,OIRNA,,English,Online Info.

The purpose of this paper is to study the online transparency of Spanish Central Government agencies and analyze whether their corporate governance (CG) structures influence their online transparency. Design/methodology/approach: The information used for building an online transparency index and about the board of directors has been collected from the websites of the 168 agencies and from their statutes and activity reports. Ordinary least squares analysis is used. Based on a previous literature review and the requirements of the EU Directive and Spanish legislation, 108 items included in the websites have been analyzed. Findings: The average information displayed through the website agencies is significantly less than the information considered as relevant in previous literature and in the Spanish legislation. The highest values are presented by the technical dimensions and the lowest by the organizational/political dimension. The presence of independent directors and women on the boards of directors are revealed as the most important explanatory factors of online transparency. Practical implications: Practical implications to improve online transparency are related to the organizational/political dimension – including the positions and CVs of members of governing bodies, minutes, etc. and to the presence of independent directors and, to a lesser extent, of women, on the board of directors.

The purpose of this paper is to focus on Spanish local government with the intention of determining the impact of the internal control structure on the disclosure of financial information on the internet. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis used combines a descriptive aspect with an explanatory one and seeks to answer the question of whether the internal control system (ICS) influences the disclosure of financial information on the websites of Spanish LGs. The authors use a multivariate model that allows us to verify the predictive capability of the previously defined explanatory variable, internal control, in 1,806 local governments. To test the hypotheses, the authors use two different models. Findings: The authors consider the existence and quality of the financial information disclosure in relation to ICSs, and a series of financial and non-financial variables. The authors conclude that the structure of the ICS influences financial information disclosure and its quality. Also, the socio-political variable gives a better explanation of financial information disclosure than the financial variable. Originality/value: This research is novel to determine whether the development of ICSs in Spanish municipalities has favored and increased the disclosure of financial information financial through the municipalities’ website transparency portal.

We identified the presence of the terms “information management” and “knowledge management” and perceived their representativeness. This study followed a qualitative approach with exploratory and descriptive emphases. The literature review was selective. The documentary analysis was based on official documents, published on the Web and carefully contrasted. We identified the institutions of the Portuguese and Spanish education systems and examined the curricula and syllabi of the programs. The results show varying degrees of incidence/coincidence of terms in both countries and the different programs that were analyzed. Comparatively, the terms are more frequent in the Spanish syllabi than in the Portuguese ones.

These exercises have the goal of guiding merit-based public funds allocation, stimulating improvement of research productivity through competition and assessing the impact of adopted research support policies. One case in point is Italy's most recent research assessment effort, VQR 2011-2014 (Research Quality Evaluation), which, in addition to research institutions, also evaluated university departments, and individuals in some cases (i.e., recently hired research staff and members of PhD committees). However, the way an institution's score was divided, according to VQR rules, between its constituent departments or its staff members does not enjoy many desirable properties well known from coalitional game theory (e.g., budget balance, fairness, marginality). We propose, instead, an alternative score division rule that is based on the notion of Shapley value, a well known solution concept in coalitional game theory, which enjoys the desirable properties mentioned above. For a significant test case (namely, Sapienza University of Rome, the largest university in Italy), we present a detailed comparison of the scores obtained, for substructures and individuals, by applying the official VQR rules, with those resulting from Shapley value computations.

Although this is not a recent phenomenon, the political and social consequences of the spreading of fake news on the internet have been thoroughly discussed in the last couple of years. Currently young people are the group with greater exposition to this reality due to the prevalence of communication technologies in their daily lives. On this article we review the literature on disinformation and analyse the longstanding relationship between false news and journalism, focusing on the particularities of the present situation. Using quantitative methodology, we conducted a survey to analyse the perceptions regarding fake news of 602 students (17-25 years-old) from higher education in Portugal. Our findings reveal a group that is clearly used to getting information online and has already contacted with fake news. However, different conceptions about what is fake news coexist, including erroneous ones. Hence, this study reaffirms the importance of media and information literacies, particularly the importance of raising awareness on credibility assessment, fact checking and the particularities of the information flows. © 2019, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Besides the obvious impact on transparency, they have an important economic potential which explains the increasing adoption of this type of initiatives. There is an increasing number of administrations that decide to create open data portals, a tendency that municipalities have followed. Few empirical papers have assessed this type of portals and the analyses have been mainly qualitative or limited to a reduced number of portals, so there are no generally accepted criteria for the assessment of their implementation. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of a method to analyse open data portals and its application to a sample of municipalities of Spain, a country at the forefront of data re-utilization in Europe. Furthermore, the econo-mic-financial information available in these portals is analysed, as it is essential to accountability, fight corruption and evaluate the financial sustainability and effectiveness of public service delivery. Results show that there is much room for improvement in this field. Only 40% of the cities analysed have an open data portal, and the average score of the sample analysed does not reach 50%. Most portals seem to work as mere data repositories, neglecting those aspects that promote data use by the non-expert public, accountability, citizen engagement and the quality of the data being disclosed (e.g., definition of the metadata used). So, the paper concludes with some recommendations for improvement. © 2019, El Profesional de la Informacion.

The analysis initially revealed values relating to the administration of public assets, such as engagement with the institution, its services and users. That was followed by professional values such as defence of access to information, data and science. The values most frequently espoused were innovation and professionalism. Libraries are encouraged to define their values which, along with their mission and vision, are a significant component of their internal and external strategy and communication policy.

What are the dominant strategies used by these entities in order to get the largest number of followers? How are the relationships with these entities through social media perceived by citizens? Questions that start from the hypothesis that the extension of social media audience of State is as relevant as that available to other large media corporations in our country, despite its recent implementation in many of its agencies. Secondly, this extension is very unequal and this depends on each entity communication policy strategy. As a third hypothesis, the extension of the accumulated audience is conditioned by the relationship and representation that society has of the different organisms.

Nevertheless, and in spite of the rise of Big Data, the prevailing absence of systematic library collection of activity data perpetuates the persistence of traditionalist and myopic approaches that tend to overlook the nexus between libraries and creativity while perceiving libraries as exclusively or basically collection gatekeepers, information brokers, and content providers. Given the universally acknowledged fact that the central value of the library is clearly creative, we embarked on the exploration of the academic library position within the Creative Industries system, as seen through the Ibero-American library community lens. In this vein, and following a literature review that focused on the interpretation of the intensity of libraries' creative value and content across different Creative Industries classification models, our survey within the library expert community attempts to investigate the relationship between academic libraries and the creative industries (CI) realm. Our overarching goal is to facilitate the articulation of targeted recommendations and to contribute to the conceptual foundations guiding the formation of a special interest group that will streamline the academic librarianship community response to this challenging area. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

This could be attributed to the strong resistance to change among librarians or the fact that the literature on the creative industries and creative knowledge is not yet fully established. In this sense, before articulating any targeted recommendations, it seemed imperative to survey the perspective of the actors involved in the topic, seeking their support through their valuable input to shape future avenues of academic librarianship engagement in the creativity advocacy cause. For this purpose, we developed a survey instrument aimed at gathering an initial set of viewpoints that would form the basis for further initiatives and at the same time raise stakeholders’ awareness in this unresolved topic.

The empirical angle is supported by an in-depth case-study of the Romano Torres publishing house, a Lisbon publisher which worked in the realm of the Portuguese language between 1885 and 1886, and 1990. To examine publishing in the case analyzed here is to understand how an intricate system of relations and their context shapes the actions and dispositions of agents. This reveals how the autonomy of each field in cultural production and circulation can only be explained by its permeability.

This specific newspaper title is remarkable because it was published in the Italian language in a predominantly German-speaking city. The two printers responsible for producing this periodical had recently migrated to Vienna from the Habsburg Low Countries. Despite recent advances in scholarship, acknowledging the importance of international news flows, foreign language newspaper ventures such as Il Corriere Ordinario have hitherto been largely ignored. This article investigates why this newspaper was printed in Vienna and argues that it was intended both for a local and international Italian(ate) audience. As a semi-official news bulletin of the imperial Habsburg government, it publicised foreign political news of its allies and became a useful tool in the fight against French propaganda. Using the case of this remarkable newspaper, I will demonstrate why and how political information moved across state and linguistic borders. © 2019 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",Habsburg empire; Italian language; newspapers; seventeenth century; transnational; Vienna,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lamal, N.; Research Foundation Flanders (FWO), Belgium; email: nina.lamal@uantwerpen.be",,Brill Academic Publishers,149527,,,,English,Quaerendo,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075574223

A survey to 383 Spanish journalists, together with four in-depth interviews to experts in the field, showed the seriousness and the deontological dimension of the problem of fake news, but journalistic ethics was not considered to be the most useful strategy against fake information. We also wanted to look for possible differences in the approach of digital and traditional journalists towards fake news and deontology. Both groups agree in blaming the economic situation of the sector and the new online communication (not necessarily journalism) context for the rising of this phenomenon.

Perceptions reflect different meanings of innovation for the citizens, as support for public investment, or the importance attributed to innovation in different key sectors of society.

By analyzing Twitter and Facebook interactions around political news in the lead-up to the election, we shed light on levels of insularity characterizing sources preferred by different partisan communities and investigate how specific patterns of active attention emerge around different sources and around stories proposing different framing of specific political actors. Our findings indicate that, on Twitter, sources mainly shared by supporters of populist parties (the Five Star Movement and the League) are characterized by higher levels of insularity compared to those shared by supporters of other parties. We also find that, on Facebook, news items published by highly insular sources receive a higher number of shares per comment. Finally, our analyses show that news presenting a positive framing of the Five Star Movement–the unique ‘cyber party’ in the system–receives a higher number of shares per comment compared to items presenting the Movement in a negative light, while the opposite is true for stories on all other political parties. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",attention economy; election campaigns; ideological self-segregation; Italy; political news; Social media,,"Open Society Foundations, OSF: OR2017-38824",This work was supported by Foundation Open Society Institute in cooperation with the Information Program of the Open Society Foundations: [grant number OR2017-38824].,,,,,,,,,,"Giglietto, F.Via Saffi 15, Italy; email: fabio.giglietto@uniurb.it",,Routledge,1369118X,,,,English,Inf.

Maltese was of the view that the Italian code of 1956 should be completely overhauled, leading to a “consistent system of clearly formulated basic principles"". The quotation of A.D. Osborn “Cataloging is an art, and as an art it is technical. Its basic rules are actually rather few and simple, and, in so far as the rules are kept few and simple, it is a delightful art to practice"" (The Library Quarterly, 11 (1941) pp. 394-305) is the key to the reading of the work. Osborn (writing in 1941, twenty years before the Paris Principles), was hoping for rules that did not relate simply to particular cases, and that were unburdened by non-essential questions; Maltese’s reference to Osborn relates above all to the general method that he wishes to adopt: the abandonment of a legalistic code that proceeds case by case and is, hence, always “behind"" with regard to the concrete manifestation and evolution of various types of publication; both are, instead, in favour of a code consisting of a small number of principles, serving as a guide, given the impossibility of foreseeing, recognizing and providing for every bibliographic eventuality. This philosophy takes maximum advantage of the professionalism and discernment of the cataloguer; the cataloguer, in fact, is called upon to use both competency and good sense - based on principles incorporated in “few and simple"" rules - to adopt the solution that is most effective for the concrete context in which the catalogue is placed. The volume issues a powerful call for a return to responsible cataloguing and to the use of precise terminology. In this way, Maltese accords significant recognition to the profession, a testimony that marks a stimulating period in its history which, in the eighties and nineties, was subject to attempts at disruption, with drastic cutbacks in cataloguers and the widespread notion that anyone was capable of cataloguing. © 2019, The Author(s).",Cataloguing; Diego maltese; Paris principles; Principi di catalogazione e regole italiane,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Guerrini, M.; Università degli Studi di FirenzeItaly; email: mauro.guerrini@unifi.it",,"Universita di Firenze, Dipartimento di Storia, Archeologia, Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo",20385366,,,,English,JLIS.it,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065580402

This period was characterized by an ever increasing need to monitor economic activities, a need perceived by the Comune with regard to all those who were entrusted with the management of public funds. In particular, in 1358 an office was created specifically to review the accounts of the camarlenghi (who were in charge of the management of public funds) nominated by the Comune of Siena. The office was originally staffed by three temporary Riveditori (auditors) and later by a permanent commission of Regolatori (regulators). On the basis of archival sources, so abundant on 14th century Siena, this paper analyses the changing relationships among the various administrative bodies of the Comune, in particular detail the Gabella generale and the Biccherna (which were the offices in charge of managing the main cash inflows and outflows pertaining to the administration of the Comune) and the activities of the Regolatori. By interpreting accounting systems as a set of rules (i.e., the formalised statements of procedures), roles (the network of social positions), and routines (the practices habitually in use), the present study shows that, since the Middle Ages, accounting has played a central role in the management of internal interdependencies and in the construction of organisational order. In the case of the Comune in the 14th century, accounting practices were capable of regulating, legitimising and balancing relations of power, dependency and autonomy among the different bodies of the same organisation. © 2019, The Author(s).",Medieval italian city state; Power relations and archives; Sienese archives and institutions; Sources on accounting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Universita di Firenze, Dipartimento di Storia, Archeologia, Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo",20385366,,,,English,JLIS.it,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065576089

His originality and method are outlined with particular attention being given to his reception in Europe and in the setting of Italian studies of theoretical and empirical linguistics. Whitney was among the first to contest Schleicher's concept of language as a natural fact, claiming, instead, that it has social nature, as an 'institution' created by man; he was a forerunner in recognizing the relevance of signs and their value, and of language acquisition. In his demonstrations and in his methods he proposes a science of historical linguistics but at the same time it is open to 20th century linguistics and the concept of language as a complex system ordered and crossed by relationships. Both his unique approach to the study of Sanskrit, which emphasised the study of its use and its variants, and his interest for modern languages, makes him a particularly interesting scholar, as he and his reception testify the rise, in Europe and especially in Italy, of a new approach to linguistic issues, no longer exclusively historical-comparative, but also theoretical and general. Nonetheless, Whitney ought to occupy a prominent place in the history of linguistics, because he was also the author of one of the first introductory texts of the discipline, which was published in 1875; in that same year a French translation came out, which was soon followed by an Italian, and a German translation (both 1876).The number of almost contemporaneous translations gives an idea of the gap which a general and introductory work like Whitney's filled and illustrates that there was a clear need for it. In several works, including recent ones, De Mauro identified the specific characteristics of Italian linguistic studies: we can find a good many of these traits in Whitney as well. Although the fruitful contribution of Whitney's ideas in an environment which is 'naturally' inclined towards the themes and methods the American linguist dealt with, i.e., the 'Italian linguistic school', has not been fully recognised until now, it is undeniable that his ideas provided an important stimulus for new interpretations and new models. © John Benjamins Publishing Company",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dovetto, F.M.; Dipartimento di Studi Umanistici, Via Porta di Massa, Italy; email: dovetto@unina.it",,John Benjamins Publishing Company,3025160,,,,English,Historiographia Linguist.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091438334

Design/methodology/approach: Syllabus mentions of 15,117 books from 27 publishers were searched for, manually checked and compared with Microsoft Academic (MA) citations. Findings: Most books published by Ariel, Síntesis, Tecnos and Cátedra have been mentioned in at least one online syllabus, indicating that their books have consistently high educational value. In contrast, few books published by the most productive publishers were mentioned in online syllabi. Prestigious publishers have both the highest educational impact based on syllabus mentions and the highest research impact based on MA citations. Research limitations/implications: The results might be different for other publishers. The online syllabus mentions found may be a small fraction of the syllabus mentions of the sampled books. Practical implications: Authors of Spanish-language social sciences and humanities books should consider general prestige when selecting a publisher if they want educational uptake for their work.

Evaluation techniques based on performance indicators or rankings risk rewarding just a specific type of university and undermining university diversification: They usually introduce homogenizing pressures and risk displacing university objectives- neglecting their socio-economic contribution and focusing on succeeding on the evaluation system. In this study, we propose an alternative evaluation method that overcomes these limitations. We produce a multidimensional descriptive classification of universities into typologies, while analysing the relation between their institutional factors (characteristics) and their (technical) efficiency performance from a descriptive perspective. To do so we apply bootstrap data envelopment analysis (DEA) and multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS), performing a so-called DEAMDS analysis on data on the Spanish university system, and unlike previous studies, we include data on an important dimension of the third mission of universities (specifically knowledge transfer, KT) in their characterization. We identify six types of (homogeneous) universities. Results indicate that to be fairly efficient, universities may focus on teaching, KT, or overall efficiency but always have to fairly perform in research. Additionally, results confirm the relevance of the third mission as a source of institutional diversity in higher education. This approach could be used to address an alternative evaluation methodology for higher education institutions with formative purposes, evaluating universities according to their unique characteristics for the improvement of HE systems. © The Author(s) 2018.",data envelopment analysis; higher education evaluation; multidimensional scaling; Spanish higher education system; third mission; typologies of universities,,,,,,,,,,,,,"De La Torre, E.M.; Department of Economics and Public Finance, Avda.

This study analyzes the evolution and current provision of research support services in Spanish academic libraries through an analysis of the three strategic plans published by the Spanish association of academic libraries (REBIUN) and a survey administered to the library directors. Results show that academic libraries are firmly embedded within universities' research activities, and that most of them depend on vice-rectorates for research or scientific policy. There is a relationship between the size of the library and its provision of research support services, although no correlation is observed between the size of the library and the staff devoted to research support. Library directors stress the value of institutional repositories, a vision also reflected in the importance assigned to open access in the strategic plans. Other current hot topics, such as data management, do not seem to be among the priorities of Spanish library directors as yet. © 2018 by the authors.",Academic libraries; Open access; Research support; Spain; University libraries,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Borrego, Á.; Departament de Biblioteconomia, Melcior de Palau, 140, Spain; email: borrego@ub.edu",,MDPI AG,23046775,,,,English,Publ.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058710188

The identification of the features of the most interactive tweets was performed in a 150-unit sample, taking into consideration the following factors: the number of retweets, likes, type of content (motivation), components forming the content, the date and time of publication, and origin of the publication (internal or unrelated). The results reveal notable practices and certain deficiencies in the strategic management of social profiles.

Methods: Handsearching, following Cochrane Collaboration guidelines, of CCTs published in Spanish dental journals from Spain and Latin America. For each eligible trial, we collected the dental specialty, the interventions evaluated, whether and how randomisation was achieved, and the corresponding bibliographic reference. Results: We handsearched 107 journals published in Spain and Latin America in Spanish. Over 17 051 articles, 244 (1.43%) were CCTs. These studies focused mainly on periodontics (70, 29.0%) and oral and maxillofacial surgery (66, 27.0%), assessing mostly pharmacological interventions (112, 46.0%). One hundred fifty-three studies (62.7%) used a random allocation of participants to study arms. Conclusions: A significant number of dental journals published in Spain and Latin America in Spanish language present original research relevant to inform clinical practice. These journals are not indexed in the major electronic databases. Practical Implications: References to the identified CCTs are now available in CENTRAL, the Cochrane Collaboration repository for these studies. We call for adherence to the CONSORT statement in dentistry to improve reporting of CCTs in journals published in Spanish language. © 2018 Health Libraries Group","clinical controlled trials; evidence-based dentistry; randomised controlled trial (RCT); review, literature; search strategies",bibliometrics; controlled clinical trial (topic); dentistry; evidence based dentistry; human; information retrieval; language; procedures; publication; South and Central America; Spain; Bibliometrics; Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic; Dentistry; Evidence-Based Dentistry; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Language; Latin America; Periodicals as Topic; Spain,Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,"We initially identified all journals that would be subjected to handsearching using methodology that has been published elsewhere (Bonfill et al., 2015).

The selected descriptors are based on aspects related to technology, procedures, content, marketing and the personnel responsible for managing repositories. Design/methodology/approach: In order to establish the indicators, a thorough review of the literature was carried out to identify existing indicators that are used to assess repositories. These were divided into five categories (technology, procedures, content, marketing and personnel) with a total of 48 components. An online survey was conducted with the repositories managers of 66 Spanish research institutions in order to verify the degree of fulfilment of the selected indicators. Findings: The survey received forty-six responses, which represented a response rate of 69 per cent. Of these, 44 came from universities and two from research centres. In total, 65 per cent of the repositories have the capacity to import data from and export data to other university systems, mainly Current Research Information System (32 per cent). Most repositories have mechanisms for the large-scale import and export of metadata and digital objects (83 per cent). The use of altmetrics in repositories is widespread (44 per cent). Authors and librarians deposit most frequently (37 and 32 per cent, respectively), in spite of the fact that 44 per cent do not have full-time staff working in the repository. In more than 80 per cent of the repositories, between 90 and 100 per cent of the deposits are full-text documents. With respect to the tools used to promote the repository within the institution, these are primarily face-to-face training sessions (82 per cent), followed by support materials such as manuals and help pages (65 per cent). The academic authorities encourage open access among researchers in 56 per cent of cases, a significant element in repository marketing. Originality/value: This work proposes a model based on five dimensions and 48 indicators to assess institutional repositories. This approach has been applied to Spanish institutional repositories to provide up-to-date information about their management procedures and promotional methods and the services they offer authors and the university community. This overview of Spanish repositories has provided an insight into the way in which repositories have evolved in recent years and allowed potential improvements to be identified based on the most advanced repositories. This model can also be exported to assess institutional repositories in other countries. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Institutional repositories; Open access; Repository assessment; Repository management; Research libraries; Spain,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN",This study was carried out under the project “Open Access to Science in Spain” (CSO2014-52830-P) of the Spanish R&D Plan funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation.,,,,,,,,,,"Serrano-Vicente, R.; Servicio de Bibliotecas, Spain; email: rserranov@unav.es",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,25149288,,,,English,Data Technol.

This research presents the results of a focus group with professional experts from seven major Spanish media that aims to learn about the bot phenomenon. Results reveal that the media are at an early stage in the adoption of this technology, although they have successful experiences on specific issues or linked to specific events such as the coverage of elections or sports events.

Data on articles from three disciplinary areas: Linguistics, Information Science and Library Science, and Pharmacology and Pharmacy, written in Portuguese and English, have been retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) covering a 20-year period (1998-2017). Figures show a rise in publications in the second decade (2008-2017) in both languages: the number of English papers is higher throughout, but the rise in the number of Portuguese papers is steeper over these latter years. Given the disparity in the number of Portuguese and English-languageWoS-indexed journals, the rise in English is probably not due to individual authorial choices, but to the lack of indexed journals in Portuguese, as well as to the constraints of the publishing market. Language choice is embedded in symbolic places of knowledge construction-in the processes of voicing research claims, in the multilayered historical processes within disciplinary communities of practice, and in the marketization of research publishing.

When this support is often claimed by the profession, it is worth asking if values such as quality of information and social responsibility are considered. To verify this, we analyze the laws about aid for media promoted by the autonomous governments in the last ten years (2007-2017), as well as the current regional legislation on institutional advertising.

Its finance is therefore subject to the Spanish Government OA mandate. A search was carried out for full-text OA copies of the 762 articles using the four tools being evaluated and with identification of the repository housing these items. Of the 762 articles concerned, 510 OA copies were found of 353 unique articles (46.3%) in 68 repositories.

The study of negation implies the correct identification of negation markers, the scope and the interpretation of how negation affects the words that are within it, that is, whether it modifies their meaning or not and if so, whether it reverses, reduces or increments their polarity value. In addition, if we are interested in managing reviews in languages other than English, the issue becomes even more problematic due to the lack of resources. The present work shows the validity of the SFU ReviewSP-NEG corpus, which we annotated at negation level, for training supervised polarity classification systems in Spanish. The assessment has involved the comparison of different supervised models. The results achieved show the validity of the corpus and allow us to state that the annotation of how negation affects the words that are within its scope is important. Therefore, we propose to add a new phase to tackle negation in polarity classification systems (phase iii): i) identification of negation cues, ii) determination of the scope of negation, iii) identification of how negation affects the words that are within its scope, and iv) polarity classification taking into account negation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Negation treatment; Polarity classification; Scope of negation; SFU corpus; Spanish sentiment analysis; Supervised learning,Data processing; Information management; Supervised learning; Negation treatment; Polarity classification; Scope of negation; Sentiment analysis; SFU corpus; Data mining,"Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER; Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, MECD: FPU014/00983; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER: TIN2015-65136-C2-1-R","This work has been partially supported by a Grant from the Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte (MECD - scholarship FPU014/00983 ), Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional ( FEDER ) and REDES project ( TIN2015-65136-C2-1-R ) from the Spanish Government.","This work has been partially supported by a Grant from the Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte (MECD - scholarship FPU014/00983), Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) and REDES project (TIN2015-65136-C2-1-R) from the Spanish Government.",,,,,,,,,"Jiménez-Zafra, S.M.; Department of Computer Science, Spain; email: sjzafra@ujaen.es",,Elsevier Ltd,3064573,,IPMAD,,English,Inf.

This study is based on an inventory of the bookseller-printer Michiel van Hamont made in 1569, at the request of the authorities searching for heretical books. This is the first survey conducted on this subject. Spanish books that have effectively circulated within the Southern Netherlands, have generally been neglected by scholars. They mainly focused their attention on local production (which books were printed by whom) and export to the Iberian World (Kingdom of Spain and Americas). They studied the rise of Antwerp as a major centre of Spanish vernacular editions and its role in the dissemination of Spanish books. The first findings in this paper show that the distribution of Spanish books in Brussels in the mid-sixteenth century is merely a marginal phenomenon.

Overall, production grew steadily before 1701 with Antwerp then Brussels and Amsterdam becoming market leaders. A staggering 350 printers and publishers are known to have been involved in producing these works, although for almost all of them, printing in Spanish was never the main part of their output. The character of these works changed over the two centuries, with religious texts growing in importance. While every book had its own history, and intended market, it seems clear that Spanish-language books were not being produced exclusively or even predominantly to target the market in Spain itself - at least not directly.

In particular, six dimensions have been studied: basic (name, URL, autonomous community and website type), structural (location, dependency and extension), hypertextual (links, targets, downloads), interactive (support, online services, comments, social networks), informational (topics, services and other resources), and graphic and multimedia (graphic elements, framing, photography, actants and other graphic resources such as video or sound). There is a great difference among the information provided by the different portals, which correlates with the strategic importance of the Saint James Way for each regional government. The prevailing thematic frame is touristic, and the aspects of the Ways of Saint James that are emphasized are regional routes, monuments and natural surroundings. The websites have more a utilitarian or practical orientation and are less focused on providing information and documentation on the Saint James Way in itself, but this aspect is also present. © 2019.

It proposes the understanding of theoretical linguistic thought in Brazil as preferentially working in monolingual situations erasing multilingual reality and mainly in written works erasing oral history and oracy, due to theoretical choices. It is this understanding of language as an object recognized in monolingual environment that promotes a lack of models to deal with multilingual environment, specially in digital world. It presents data on living languages today in the world and on those that are part of the world wide web. And from these data, it considers the notion of big data in relation to the linguistic reality of multilingual countries that have Portuguese as their official language, particularly considering the activities of study and production of knowledge.

Research shows that subject area and access type are determinants in terms of the degree of internationality of the journals, as well as, to a lesser extent, publisher type. The Impact Factor (IF), flagship of bibliometric impact, does not correlate with any element of internationality, while the values of SJR and SNIP moderately correlate with the percentage of international collaborations. Foreign authors' participation is related with English language presence, revealing the orientation of the indexed Spanish journals towards the ""core"" scientific countries. The presence of foreign members in committees is accompanied by that of foreign authors, even though a cause-effect relation cannot be proved. The study concludes providing some insights on future research lines. © 2018 CSIC.",Acceso abierto; Bibliometric impact; Colaboración científica; Comités editoriales; Editorial boards; España; Impacto bibliométrico; Internacionalidad; International collaboration; Internationality; Lengua de publicación; Open access; Publication language; Revistas científicas; Scholarly journals; Spain,,"Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, METI","(CSO2014-52830-P), of the Spanish R&D Plan funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness.",,,,,,,,,,,,CSIC Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas,2100614,,,,English,Rev.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodological approach used in this paper is based on a multiple case study analysis involving a set of 3PLs operating in Italy and Sweden. The empirical analysis has explored the KM practices used by 3PLs and the main barrier hindering their adoption. Findings: In spite of some adoption, the findings suggest that 3PLs are not sufficiently realizing the full potential of KM. The evidence also indicates that there is a link between the type of 3PL company (in terms of the breadth and complexity of the services supplied) and the sophistication of KM tools adopted. Research limitations/implications: From a research point of view, further research should focus on the validation of the link between the number and sophistication of KM tools used and the breadth of services supplied. Further research should also focus on exploring how KM can support 3PL companies in enhancing their performance. Practical implications: From a practical point of view, the findings may help the management of 3PL companies to take a more strategic approach to KM and thus its contribution to the firms’ overall goals. Additionally, it is critical to conduct a careful analysis of current and future KM needs to identify the most suitable KM solutions linked to the specific characteristics of the business in which 3PLs operate.

This paper aims to focus on the work undertaken in the field of literary translation by the women writers of this period. Design/methodology/approach: Mnemosyne is an open-access digital library that allows data modeling for specific collections (women translators, science fiction, etc.) in support of research and teaching on Silver Age Spain. The first version of the library is stored on the server at the Universidad Complutense Library, and it is linked to the collections of the digital library HathiTrust and Biblioteca Nacional de España. Behind the scenes of Mnemosyne’s public presence online, the project is developing with the aid of the tool Clavy which is a rich internet application that is able to import, preserve and edit information from big data collections of digital objects so as to build bridges between institutional and digital repositories and create collections of enriched digital content. See:http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/queesmnemosine.php Findings: The Collection Women Translators in Spain (1868-1936) inside Mnemosyne selects, categorizes and makes visible in digital format women translators and literary translations that belong to a forgotten repertoire to allow the historical review of the period. The digital collection of Spanish Women Translators pretends to be a field of international experimentation for the creation of interoperable semantic networks through which a large group of scholars could generate innovative research and theoretical reading models for literary texts. See:http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/colecciones.php Research limitations/implications: Clavy also provides a basic system of data visualization, edition and navigation. There are plans to integrate @Note, a collaborative annotation application, into Clavy. These two computational tools were developed by the software languages research group ILSA[1] at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Practical implications: Its been followed NEWW Women Writers’ categories concerning biographical categories as successful standard for ensuring interoperability in the near future: children, marital status, social class, religion, profession and other activities, financial aspects, memberships. See:http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/ver_documento.php?documento=208369 Social implications: These women also showed their interest in the writings of contemporary women by translating their works into Spanish or glossing foreign ideas about how the modern woman should be, think or behave. This digital collection shows the first steps of the intellectual women in the South of Europe. Originality/value: To incorporate specially tailored metadata for the women translators’ collection into Mnemosyne, it will be necessary to use of Clavy’s extensibility to account for the particularities of the women translators’ collection. This is where prior knowledge of this literature’s historical and cultural context proves indispensable. In particular, the specific metadata model for the women translators’ collection incorporates elements that reflect the literary, historical and cultural characteristics of the collections. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital humanities; Mnemosyne; Spanish women translators; Womens issues,article; child; cultural factor; female; human; human experiment; humanities; Internet; language; major clinical study; marriage; metadata; occupation; publication; religion; social class; software; Spain; Spaniard; teaching; writing,Universidad Complutense de Madrid,"generate innovative research and theoretical reading models for literary texts.

Authors argue that in a few but difficult cases, it was necessary, by hard conceptual work, to define whether the term in a chapter or section was used in its traditional meaning or in a meaning that was partially or completely new, because it was essential not to deprive the original text of its - real or attempted - innovative potential. In translating new terms of RDA, three possible approaches are to use in different cases: following tradition, common use, or relying on the context. The authors believe that all the three approaches are correct, but when the results from the first or the second approach are ineffective or doubtful, only the last one - relying on the context - can support the correct, and hopefully largely agreed, decision. © 2018, The Author(s).",Bibliographic description; Cataloguing standards; FRBR; Italy; RDA; Translations,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bianchini, C.; University of PaviaItaly; email: carlo.bianchini@unipv.it",,"Universita di Firenze, Dipartimento di Storia, Archeologia, Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo",20385366,,,,English,JLIS.it,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040788769

The deposit, comprising around 2000 vessels covered a wide area, and seems to have been arranged with a certain degree of organization. The material can be dated to the 17th and beginning of the 18th Dynasty. Excavation and research at Sector 10 undertaken until February 2016 has confirmed the presence of ceramic material of these periods in other parts of the same area, which fits well with the rest of the discoveries from Sector 10.

The first three campaigns, carried out between 2011 and 2013, were actually brief surveys, strongly affected by the political instability of the country. During these surveys, the mission identified most of the structures already brought to light and recorded by previous investigations. Finally, during the campaign of autumn 2014, it was possible to work longer and to start the topographical survey and the investigation of the numerous structures still extant on the site. The town wall, overall enclosing an area of about 92.000 square meters, was acquired and measured with a Total Station. From the satellite images of the site, it was possible to identify a series of alignments in the NW quarter of the site, running EW at an average distance of 25m from each other. These alignments are very likely to correspond to the foundations or the lower courses of buildings for military cantonment of the Roman phase. Differently from monumental buildings of Roman time and churches of the early Christian period in Egypt, which were the object of in-depth studies during the last century, and are rather well known, the domestic architecture of the early Christian time still deserves further attention. For this reason, the mission put a particular focus on the Northern Sector of the site, characterized by a long row of housing units - 90 were recorded - and a first typology was set up. During the same season, the study of the previously discovered findings was also started. From the analysis of the two inventories kept in el-Ashmunein and Asyut (Shutbi), it was possible to determine the number and nature of all the findings and their conservation status. Unfortunately, however, only very vague information exist on the systems of grids and squares used by previous excavators and on the provenance of these findings. After the inventory survey, the study of the materials was undertaken at el-Ashmunein, where 152 specimens were analysed, catalogued and photographed. The preliminary observation of the finds (especially ceramics, paintings and architectural elements) and inscriptions allowed us to suggest an outline of the history of the site, divided into three main phases of life and at least three others of less regular human presence, which can be summarized as follows: A) Pharaonic Period (?); b) Ptolemaic Period (?); c) Late Roman Period; d) First Christian phase: End of the 5th/6th century; e) Second Christian phase corresponding to the first phase of the Islamic Period: 8th century; f) Second Islamic phase: 19th century (Mahmud II) (Pirelli 2015). However, this paper presents the results achieved so far by the Mission, on only four specific subjects: General features of the housing units; stone architectural elements; pottery; and inscriptions. © Archaeopress and the authors 2017.

(2015). Namely the evaluation of concordance, based on Cohen's kappa, reported by Ancaiani et al. was not computed on the whole random sample of 9,199 articles, but on a subset of 7,597 articles. The kappas relative to the whole random sample were in the range 0.07-0.15, indicating an unacceptable agreement between peer review and bibliometrics. The subset was obtained by non-random exclusion of all articles for which bibliometrics produced an uncertain classification; these raw data were not disclosed, so that concordance analysis is not reproducible. The VQR-weighted kappa for Area 13 reported by Ancaiani et al. is higher than that reported by Area 13 panel and confirmed by Bertocchi et al. (2015), a difference explained by the use, under the same name, of two different set of weights. Two values of kappa reported by Ancaiani et al. differ from the corresponding ones published in the official report. Results reported by Ancaiani et al. do not support a good concordance between peer review and bibliometrics. As a consequence, the use of both techniques introduced systematic distortions in the final results of the Italian research assessment exercise. The conclusion that it is possible to use both technique as interchangeable in a research assessment exercise appears to be unsound, by being based on a misinterpretation of the statistical significance of kappa values. © The Author 2017.

This study proposes an empirical definition of political communication style with the aim of identifying characteristics of the populist political communication style. Between 2015 and 2016, the Twitter timelines of the main political leaders in Italy were analysed for 16 months. Applying an MCA allowed us to identify two key factors that characterise the communication styles of leaders: (1) communication mode, comparing negative and positive; and (2) communicative focus, comparing personalisation and political/campaign. The intersection of these two factors resulted in four different political communication styles: ‘Engaging’, ‘Intimate’, ‘Champion of the people’ and ‘Man of the street’. The latter two were clearly characterised by the presence of populist ideology fragments and traits, but were not strictly related to the leaders’ ideological positions. This result supports the hypothesis that populist style is less and less connected to the right/left political cleavage, but rather the result of a varied combination of gradations that mix different individual aspects of the leader’s political communication style. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",political communication style; political leaders; popularisation; Populism; Twitter,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bracciale, R.; Department of Political Science, via Serafini, 3, Italy; email: roberta.bracciale@unipi.it",,Routledge,1369118X,,,,English,Inf.

After revising the concept of third mission as a field for data development and its importance in assessing university performance, we applied various data envelopment analysis models with different specifications to 47 Spanish public universities to test whether KT indicators are relevant when evaluating the performance of HEIs in terms of their efficiency and, if so, which indicators are most suitable. Our results suggest that the effect of including KT indicators in the efficiency analyses varies from university to university according to their characteristics. The subject mix taught at the university, the focus according to each mission's relative importance within the total range of activities carried out in each university (mission mix), and the mix of their third mission activities affect the increase of the universities' efficiency scores when KT is taken into account in the analysis.

The results obtained, based on a quantitative approach with the data-collecting instrument of a questionnaire sent to a sample of 311 Portuguese municipal archives, showed evidence of a gradual change in work mentality and in archive and archivists’ procedures, noting a certain awakening to the practice of intrapreneurship. In identifying the main practices stimulating intrapreneurship in the archives studied, it was possible to identify some explanatory dimensions (factors) of this phenomenon: (1) autonomy, pro-activeness, creation of products and climate, (2) orientation towards goals, competence and risk, (3) market, social and decision, (4) functionality and status, and (5) reward and competitiveness. This study is seen as being of the greatest importance, due to the information and knowledge society becoming increasingly important for the economy, especially following one of the most serious crises in Portugal’s history. It was therefore necessary to find out to what extent these information professionals are intrapreneurs within their archives, taking advantage of existing resources but also of their wisdom and competences in its service. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",archive; Archivists; information management; innovation; intrapreneurship; Portuguese municipalities,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Franco, M.; University of Beira Interior, Portugal; email: mfranco@ubi.pt",,SAGE Publications Ltd,9610006,,,,English,J.

In the Italian archival field, this concept is called sedimentazione, which literally translates as sedimentation. In the international context, the use of this term is uncommon, as sedimentation is not originally an archival term. However, the term is widely used in Italian archival literature and language. This article provides clarifications on the meaning of archival sedimentation and its use in the Italian context. The connotations of spontaneity and/or intentionality of the sedimentation process are analyzed, and a definition of archival sedimentation is proposed. Archives’ attributes, such as natural, spontaneous and organic, are put in relation to the sedimentation process, and considerations about their ambiguous meaning are made. Finally, reflections are presented on the present-day connotations that archival sedimentation holds. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Archival sedimentation; Archive attributes; Naturalness; Organic; Spontaneous,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mata Caravaca, M.; The International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM), Via di San Michele 13, Italy; email: mmc@iccrom.org",,Springer Netherlands,13890166,,,,English,Archival Sci.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944524787

These are the same issues that health communicators face when understanding how best to communicate important health information to Latinos. The Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) offers a unique opportunity to understand the health communication landscape and information needs of the U.S. population. We describe the challenges in recruiting Spanish-speaking HINTS respondents and strategies used to improve rates and quality of responses among Spanish-speaking Latinos. Cognitive interviewing techniques helped to better understand how Spanish-speaking Latinos were interpreting the survey questions, and the extent to which these interpretations matched English-speaking respondents’ interpretations. Some Spanish-speaking respondents had difficulty with the questions because of a lack of access to health care. Additionally, Spanish-speaking respondents had a particularly hard time answering questions that were presented in a grid format. We describe the cognitive interview process, and consider the impact of format changes on Spanish-speaking people’s responses and response quality. We discuss challenges that remain in understanding health information needs of non-English-speakers.

We observed that, in order to achieve various levels of intimacy on Facebook, people engage in various strategies: Showing rather than telling, Sharing implicit content, Tagging, Expectation of mutual understanding and Liking. These strategies produce a collaborative disclosure that relies on others’ cooperation to maintain the boundaries between private and public space. Based on these premises, we developed a framework of collaborative strategies for managing public intimacy that both systematizes and extends the findings identified in previous studies of intimacy on Facebook. We describe this framework as networked intimacy and we discuss the consequences of it in the light of already existing research on online self-disclosure. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Facebook; intimacy; self-disclosure; social network,,PRIN 2009SRXSW5,"This work was supported by Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universit? e della Ricerca [PRIN 2009SRXSW5].",,,,,,,,,,"Farci, M.; Department of Communication Sciences, Italy; email: manolo.farci@uniurb.it",,Routledge,1369118X,,,,English,Inf.

Therefore, Business Model Innovation (BMI) becomes the key process to unleash value creation for both established and new companies, and, among these latter, particularly for technological spin-offs. For their constituent characteristics, it emerges that BMI in technological spin-offs appears to be related to the effective management of the Intellectual Capital (IC). Despite this, current research has paid little attention to decline BMI through the lenses of IC. This study aims to provide a contribution in this direction by investigating how technological spin-offs innovate their BM by leveraging their IC dimensions. A review of relevant literature on BMI has been carried out. Then, a case study methodology has been adopted to analyze seven technological spin-offs. The analysis highlighted three main trajectories of BMI, defined in terms of the BMI scope and the main exploited IC dimension. The discussion of findings from a research and practical perspective contributes to the debate on BMI, by providing a new interpretative key based on the relevance of the IC dimensions.",Business Model Innovation; Case studies; Intellectual Capital; Knowledge assets; Spin-offs; Technology-intensive industries,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Elia, G.; Department of Engineering for Innovation, Via per Monteroni snc, Italy; email: gianluca.elia@unisalento.it",,Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.,14778238,,,,English,Knowl.

The penultimate one – i.e., the VQR 2004–2010, which adopted a hybrid evaluation approach based on bibliometric analysis and peer review – suffered heavy criticism at a national and international level. The architecture of the subsequent exercise – i.e., the VQR 2011–2014, still in progress – is partly similar to that of the previous one, except for a few presumed improvements. Nevertheless, this other exercise is suffering heavy criticism too. This paper presents a structured discussion of the VQR 2011–2014, collecting and organizing some critical arguments so far emerged, and developing them in detail. Some of the major vulnerabilities of the VQR 2011–2014 are: (1) the fact that evaluations cover a relatively small fraction of the scientific publications produced by the researchers involved in the evaluation, (2) incorrect and anachronistic use of the journal metrics (i.e., ISI Impact Factor and similar ones) for assessing individual papers, and (3) conceptually misleading criteria for normalizing and aggregating the bibliometric indicators in use. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bibliometric evaluation; Italian VQR; Journal metric; Peer review; Percentile rank; Research assessment exercise,Computer applications; Bibliometric; Italian VQR; Journal metric; Peer review; Percentile rank; Research assessment exercise; Societies and institutions,,,,,,,,,,,,"Franceschini, F.; Politecnico di Torino, Corso Duca degli Abruzzi 24, Italy; email: fiorenzo.franceschini@polito.it",,Elsevier Ltd,17511577,,,,English,J.

This article contributes to the current debate on Web 2.0 technologies and their implications for local governance through the identification of governance models to be adopted by local governments if Web 2.0 technologies are implemented for providing public services. Also, this article analyzes whether the political competition could be an attribute that could explain the governance models to be adopted by municipalities. To achieve this aim, an e-survey during the period of May–July 2014 has been performed by policy makers responsible of strategies for e-government in Spanish municipalities. Findings indicate that policy makers are mainly prone to implement Web 2.0 technologies under the “Bureaucratic Model” framework, keeping the leading role in this implementation. Nonetheless, political competition seems to be essential to understand the findings of this article. Thus, majority governments are prone to implement collaborative models of governance, whereas minority governments are in favor to implement noncollaborative models of governance. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",governance models; political factors; public services; Web 2.0 technologies,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bolívar, M.P.R.; Faculty of Business Studies, C/Campus Universitario de Cartuja s/n, P.O. 18071, Spain; email: manuelp@ugr.es",,SAGE Publications Inc.,8944393,,,,English,Soc.

The results indicate that management research has gained ground in the last decade, as revealed by the apparition of new journals and the number of articles published. The article also shows that Spain has a different profile of published articles than that of the other countries, as its production is mostly composed of empirical-quantitative articles.

To do so, the first step is to contextualize the library and a culture written as the flag of the modern/euro centered project. After this, the case of the Cajamarca Rural Library Networks is studied as a possible affirmative action. Finally, a library proposal is submitted based on and with southern epistemology. An Intercultural library project also responds to the decolonization practices of a being and power via knowledge. Moreover, the theoretical methodological approach is hermeneutical‑ critical and part of a document review the network proposed.

It was presented to librarians from across Italy on 8 February 2007 in Florence as a new edition of the Soggettario (1956), and it has become the official Italian subject indexing tool. This system is made up of two individual and interactive components: the general thesaurus, accessible on the web since 2007 and the rules of a conventional syntax for the construction of subject strings. The Nuovo soggettario thesaurus has grown significantly in terms of terminology and connections with other knowledge organization tools (e.g., encyclopedias, dictionaries, resources of archives and museums, and other information data sets), offering the users the possibility to browse through documents, books, objects, photographs, etc. The conversion of the Nuovo soggettario thesaurus into formats suitable for the semantic web and linked data world improves its function as an interlinking hub for direct searching and for organizing content by different professional communities. Thanks to structured data and the SKOS format, the Nuovo soggettario thesaurus is published on the Data Hub platform, thus giving broad visibility to the BNCF and its precious patrimony. © 2017 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

Design/methodology/approach: A brief literature review of international authors from the stakeholder approach and Corporate Community Relations (CCRs) field is presented. This paper refers to a survey of Lombard industrial districts conducted by ALTIS. The data were collected via a telephone survey from 834 firms. Findings: The main finding is that managing CCRs is of major importance for company success. The results of the survey show that there are some tools and actions that Italian industrial district SMEs use to interact with their particular communities of place to develop effective and coherent relationships with their stakeholder groups. Moreover, although the survey shows that though SMEs do implement different CCR activities, they are not able to communicate these effectively through systematic communication strategies. However, the narrow sample includes only a sample of some Lombard districts. Nonetheless, the findings indicate that effective CCR seems to confer competitive advantage based on stakeholder responses and rewards sought. Research limitations/implications: The framework could assist in supporting CCR developments between industrial districts as various players would know how to improve CCR activities. One further suggestion is that University and Research Centers could have a role to play in creating and communicating codified knowledge concerning community relations in industrial districts, while other public players still have to develop specific tasks in improving infrastructures. Originality/value: This study is in line with the main focus of CCR, which is in striving to meet stakeholder and societal needs. However, industrial district SMEs have to learn how to communicate their CCR activities from the examples set by large Italian companies. The paper links the notion of CCR with tools and actions to develop meaningful relationships with both community of place and interest. Moreover, considering the survey results, a new framework for local player roles is proposed. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Communication; Community relations; Industrial districts; SMEs enterprises; Social responsibility; Stakeholder approach,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Foroudi, P.; Business School, United Kingdom; email: p.foroudi@mdx.ac.uk",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,0888045X,,,,English,Bottom line,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033688805

We studied the 2016 election in Spain based on an analysis of quantitative content. The sample consists of 9,042 tweets, published by the four parties that received the most votes and their candidates. The results show: First, the most widely used function was the dissemination of political proposals. Second, a low level of personalization was detected. Third, there was an incipient tendency towards hybridization between new and conventional digital media in the use of this platform. Finally, it was shown that the functions given to Twitter are conditioned, in different ways, by three factors: The historical trajectory of the party, its position on the government-opposition line, and the individual or collective dimension.",Digital media; Electoral campaigns; Hybridization; Personalization; Political communication; Social media; Social networking sites; Twitter,,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO",Amparo López-Meri has a PhD in Journalism and is a lecturer in the Department of Communica ? tion Sciences at the Universitat Jaume I de Castelló 縀币褁ȁ崁瘃缃堀 Her lines of research focus on the reformulation of journalism and political communication in the digital environment 堀 ?he also rese-ar ches in fields such as media ethics and innovation in higher education 堀 ?he participates in research projects financed by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness of Spain 堀 For twelve years she worked as a journalist and news editor in ?panish media 堀 http 圃氃?orcid 堁紁谁倃氃爃爃爃?,,,,,,,,,,"López-Meri, A.; Universitat Jaume i de Castelló, Avda.

Sedimentation has always happened, oftentimes unconsciously, in archival practice, and has had profound effects on the preservation of documents and their transmission over time. This essay aims to explore how sedimentation takes place in the archives. After describing the meanings and uses of the notion of sedimentation in the history of archival theory, the essay focuses on the history of sedimentation, that is, the ways in which sedimentation took place in different time periods in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. One of the insights offered by this study is that sedimentation has never occurred involuntarily or by chance; rather, it has always reflected, albeit indirectly, the political and administrative needs of the age in which it was executed and has anticipated any future uses of the sedimented materials. Archival sedimentation is “historical” exactly because it takes place within the history of the society in which each archives is produced and maintained. On the one hand, sedimentation is part of the micro-history of that society because it depends on the actions of few individuals, and on the other hand, it is involved in the cultural and juridical macro-history of its time. The essay concludes with the suggestion that the history of archival sedimentation should be seen as a constitutive part of the knowledge of any given time period. Sedimentation is an integral part of our historical collective memory. © 2017. Association of Canadian Archivists.

The methods used were the quantitative analysis of the linguistic corpus in 474 texts and a critical analysis of the discourse in a selection of the sample.

For example, the sentence ""Roberto Marinho is the founder of Rede Globo"" expresses a relation occurring between ""Roberto Marinho"" and ""Rede Globo."" This work presents a system for Portuguese Open Relation Extraction, named RelP, which extracts any relation descriptor that describes an explicit relation between named entities in the organisation domain by applying the Conditional Random Fields. For implementing RelP, we define the representation scheme, features based on previous work, and a reference corpus. RelP achieved state of the art results for open relation extraction; the F-measure rate was around 60% between the named entities person, organisation and place. For better understanding of the output, we present a way for organizing the output from the mining of the extracted relation descriptors. This organization can be useful to classify relation types, to cluster the entities involved in a common relation and to populate datasets.",Endues; Open relation extraction; Portuguese; Relations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,International Society for Knowledge Organization,9437444,,,,English,Knowl.

The paper also compares differences in the influence of perceived value on satisfaction and of satisfaction on loyalty to AMMS in Spain and Greece, to test the moderating effect of culture. Design/methodology/approach: Partial least squares path modelling is used to test the model. Perceived value is modelled as a multidimensional reflective construct with four dimensions. Culture is studied at a national level. Differences between countries are tested using the multigroup analysis approach proposed by Henseler et al. (2009). Findings: Perceived value contributes significantly to satisfaction. Satisfaction also has a significant effect on loyalty. Regarding the moderating effect of culture, the influence of perceived value on satisfaction is higher in Greece than in Spain. The authors report similar findings for the effect of satisfaction on loyalty, demonstrating the relevant moderating role of cultures with different degrees of masculinity, uncertainty avoidance and collectivism. Practical implications: This cross-cultural comparison enables mobile phone companies to understand how to provide the greatest value with AMMS in each country in order to increase user satisfaction and loyalty to the service. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that develops cross-cultural research to analyse the post-acceptance of mobile services. It analyses the effect of perceived value and satisfaction, making an original comparison of two countries generally considered too similar to be compared. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cross-cultural issues; Cross-national study; Customer satisfaction/service; Mobile communications; Post-implementation; Service quality (SERVQUAL),,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hernandez-Ortega, B.; Department of Marketing, Spain; email: bhernand@unizar.es",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,9593845,,,,English,Inf.

In this framework, the National Library of Florence and the National bibliographic agency, belonging to it, suffered a significant reshaping of their output, the Italian National Bibliography (BNI), due to the reduction of people in its editorial staff. The search for solutions to cope with this difficult situation lead to two main decisions, both based on the meaning of public service and on the cooperation principle. The first had the result of the free and online publication of the Italian National Bibliography, starting from May 2016, so that aligning the BNI to other National European Bibliographies. The latter lead to a collaboration project that on one side confirmed the role of the National Library of Florence as bibliographic, technical and editorial coordinator, and on the other opens the National Bibliography to a certain number of libraries with specific traits (legal deposition coverage and subject specialisation), so that contributing to a collaborative Italian National Bibliography. © 2017, The Author(s).",Cataloguing; Italian national bibliography (BNI); National library of florence; National library service (SBN); Open data,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bellingeri, L.; Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di FirenzeItaly; email: luca.bellingeri@beniculturali.it",,"Universita di Firenze, Dipartimento di Storia, Archeologia, Geografia, Arte e Spettacolo",20385366,,,,Italian,JLIS.it,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019834588

The reason lays in how well the genre served a variety of purposes; their language, for example, couched as they were in the idiom of high officialdom but still setting examples of the correct usage of the Italian vernacular. Not least, was their function as bearer of chronicles of contemporary events and famous personalities. The publication in 1564 of Sansovino's Del secretario launched a new genre of epistolary: The book was not only a collection of letters, but also a treatise on the role and function of the court secretary. Subsequently, texts and indexes took to being organized by rhetorical typology which enhanced their relevance. In the end, however, the standardized models that prevailed were bereft of any reference to contemporary events. © 2017 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",book history; epistolary collections; Erasmus; history of reading; history of writing; Italian Renaissance; Venice,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Braida, L.; University of MilanItaly; email: lodovica.braida@unimi.it",,Brill Academic Publishers,149527,,,,English,Quaerendo,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018682733

Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the field of study that analyses people’s opinions and mood from written text available on the Web. In this paper, we present extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the psychological and linguistic features for sentiment classification. To this purpose, we have used four psycholinguistic dimensions obtained from LIWC, and one stylometric dimension obtained from WordSmith, for the subsequent training of the SVM, Naïve Bayes, and J48 algorithms. Also, we create a corpus of tourist reviews from the travel website TripAdvisor. The findings reveal that the stylometric dimension is quite feasible for sentiment classification.

Due to the great impact which flamenco dance has had in recent years, it has become widely known and practised around the word. In 2010 flamenco reached a status that was never thought possible when it was named as a World Heritage Treasure. Because of this and the huge impact of flamenco in our time, the need to research this art is clearly justified. All types of dance truthfully reflect culture and society. Flamenco is no exception. The aim of this article is to clarify the most usual gestures and technical abilities of flamenco dance which preserve its essence as well as to favour an autonomous learning of flamenco. For this purpose an analysis of both the origins of flamenco and its main features and terminology has been developed. Subsequently, sources available for the improvement, development and learning of flamenco have been established, with a particular focus on technological sources.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination can prevent most HPV infections that cause more than 90% of cervical cancer. Unfortunately, limited knowledge and low rates of HPV vaccination persist among Latinas. The current study compared awareness, knowledge, beliefs, acceptability, uptake, and 3-dose series completion of HPV vaccination between Latinas who prefer English (EPL) and those who prefer Spanish (SPL), ages 18–62, living in Southern California. (The 3-dose series completion was based on HPV vaccine completion guidelines at the time of the study. HPV vaccination guidelines do change over time to improve coverage.) More EPL (n = 57) than SPL (n = 150) reported significantly (a) more HPV vaccine awareness and more knowledge of where to access the vaccine and additional vaccine information and (b) greater endorsement of vaccine effectiveness and safety (p <.05). Regardless of language preference, Latinas reporting knowledge of where to access the vaccine and additional information endorsed greater acceptability of the vaccine and more favorable beliefs regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness (p <.05). In multivariate analyses, language and income predicted the outcomes of knowledge regarding accessing the vaccine and additional information. Only 15.6% of all eligible Latinas (n = 45) initiated the HPV vaccine, with 8.9% completion. Interventions seeking to improve HPV vaccination should address linguistic and socioecological differences within Latinas to enhance effectiveness.

However, the literature regarding workplace incivility and bullying in academic libraries is under reported and under researched. This study examines the current state of librarians' perceptions on workplace incivility and bullying and evaluates the effects of bullying from organizational and individual perspectives. Bullying was measured based on the librarian's responses to the Negative Acts Questionnaire, including both experienced bullying and witnessed bullying. The authors introduce a conceptual framework to understand the motivating structures, precipitating circumstances, and enabling structures that lead to bullying in the library. A statistical analysis using a regression model revealed several factors that influenced bullying, including a librarian's ethnicity, the number of years worked in the library, the type of institution, and a librarian's academic status. The findings can be useful for discussions of improving workplace climate, increasing retention and recruitment for academic librarians, and helping early career librarians throughout the promotion and tenure processes. © 2016 Shin Freedman and Dawn Vreven.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Association of College and Research Libraries,100870,,,,English,Coll.

Other trends of research have investigated the advantages, limits, performances and difficulties of interdisciplinary research, which is increasingly advocated by the main lines of public research funding. This paper explores the dynamics of interdisciplinary research in Italy over 10 years of scientific collaboration on research projects. Instead of looking at the output of research, i.e. publications, we analyse the original research proposals that have been funded by the Ministry of University and Research for a specific line of funding, the Research Projects of National Interest. In particular, we want to see how much interdisciplinary research has been conducted during the period under analysis and how changes in the overall amount of public funding might have affected disciplinary and interdisciplinary collaboration. We also want to cluster the similarities and differences of the amount of disciplinary and interdisciplinary collaboration across scientific disciplines, and see if it changes over time. Finally, we want to see if interdisciplinary projects receive an increasing share of funding compared to their disciplinary bounded counterparts. Our results indicate that while interdisciplinary research diminishes along the years, potentially responding to the contraction of public funding, research that cut across disciplinary boundaries overall receives more funding than research confined within disciplinary boundaries. Furthermore, the clustering procedure do not indicate clear and stable distinction between disciplines, but similar patterns of disciplinary and interdisciplinary collaboration are shown by discipline with common epistemological frameworks, which share compatible epistemologies of scientific investigations. We conclude by reflecting upon the implications of our findings for research policies and practices and by discussing future research in this area. © 2016, The Author(s).",Cluster analysis; Interdisciplinary; Scientific collaborations; Scientific networks; Scientometrics; Social network analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bellotti, E.; Department of Sociology, United Kingdom; email: elisa.bellotti@manchester.ac.uk",,Springer Netherlands,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978872860

Three different interpolation techniques were evaluated: the Local Weighted Linear Regression (LWLR), the Regression-Kriging (RK) and the Regression-Kriging with stepwise selection (RKS), a modification of RK. The performances of the different models were evaluated by the leave-one-out validation procedure, comparing the results from the models with the original data and calculating different error measurements. The three techniques performed better for Tmax than for Tmin, and for the cold, rather than warmer months, also at lower altitude than highland areas. The best results were achieved with LWLR applied for the first time on temperatures in the Spanish mainland. This method improved the accuracy of the temperature reconstruction with respect to RK and RKS.

Bibliometric evaluation versus informed peer review in the Italian research assessment exercise”. Our paper analyzed results of the experiment conducted by the Italian governmental agency ANVUR during the research assessment exercise about the agreement between informed peer review (IR) and bibliometrics. We argued that according to available statistical guidelines, results of the experiment are indicative of a poor agreement in all research fields with only one exception, results reached in the so called Area 13 (economics and statistics). We argued that this difference was due to the changes introduced in Area 13 with respect to the protocol adopted in all the other areas. Bertocchi et al.’s comment dismiss our explanation and suggest that the difference was due to “differences in the evaluation processes between Area 13 and other areas”. In addition, they state that all our five claims about Area 13 experiment protocol “are either incorrect or not based on any evidence”. Based on textual evidence drawn from ANVUR official reports, we show that: (1) none of the four differences listed by Bertocchi et al. is peculiar of Area 13; (2) their five arguments contesting our claims about the experiment protocol are all contradicted by official records of the experiment itself. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Bibliometric evaluation; Bibliometrics; Informed peer review; Italian VQR; Meta-analysis; Open science; Peer review; Research assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baccini, A.; Department of Economics and Statistics, Piazza San Francesco 7, Italy; email: alberto.baccini@unisi.it",,Springer Netherlands,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Letter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978045095

The present paper takes advantage of the funding acknowledgements (FA) section included in WoS articles written in English and studies some features of the funded research, such as impact and collaboration. For this purpose, articles with Spain in the address field are selected and retrieved (years 2008–2013), dividing them in two sets: articles with or without FA. Besides, given the large volume of items, the study is focused on groups of articles of each area selected by stratified random sampling. Additionally, those items with a FA section are analysed to identify three types of funding sources: only public, only private, or both sectors. The results show differences between areas in terms of presence of FA and types of funding sectors. On the one hand, in general, articles funded by both the public and private sectors present the best impact, as well as the highest number of authors and organisations. On the other hand, there are important variations in impact and collaboration between areas depending on types of funding sectors. Thus, items funded by both the public and private sectors show the highest significant impact in Clinical Medicine, Life Sciences and Physics, having also greater international collaboration, in most areas, than articles funded only by the public sector. Finally, some limitations of this study are identified and some recommendations for funders and authors are offered. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Collaboration; Funding acknowledgements; Funding sectors; Impact; Public–private interactions; Spanish scientific publications; Statistical analyses; WoS,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Morillo, F.; Centre for Human and Social Sciences (CCHS), Albasanz 26-28, Spain; email: fernanda.morillo@cchs.csic.es",,Springer Netherlands,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976324075

A sample of articles was evaluated by using both methods and agreement was analyzed by weighted Cohen’s kappas. ANVUR presented results as indicating an overall “good” or “more than adequate” agreement. This paper re-examines the experiment results according to the available statistical guidelines for interpreting kappa values, by showing that the degree of agreement (always in the range 0.09–0.42) has to be interpreted, for all research fields, as unacceptable, poor or, in a few cases, as, at most, fair. The only notable exception, confirmed also by a statistical meta-analysis, was a moderate agreement for economics and statistics (Area 13) and its sub-fields. We show that the experiment protocol adopted in Area 13 was substantially modified with respect to all the other research fields, to the point that results for economics and statistics have to be considered as fatally flawed. The evidence of a poor agreement supports the conclusion that IR and bibliometrics do not produce similar results, and that the adoption of both methods in the Italian research assessment possibly introduced systematic and unknown biases in its final results. The conclusion reached by ANVUR must be reversed: the available evidence does not justify at all the joint use of IR and bibliometrics within the same research assessment exercise. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Bibliometric evaluation; Cohen’s kappa; Informed peer review; Italian VQR; Meta-analysis; Peer review; Research assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baccini, A.; Department of Economics and Statistics, Piazza San Francesco 7, Italy; email: baccini@unisi.it",,Springer Netherlands,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961774394

The study was carried out with a corpus of 137 abstracts, follows a Text Linguistics model inspired by the Interactionnisme Sociodiscoursif and links text features to the social practices and genre repertoires of this community. Quantitative data show signs of a “Portuguese identity” in authors’ voices such as personal forms, move signaling, long sentences, profuse embedding, heavy subjects, and variations in content selection, but also signs of standard academic guideline-indexed choices in impersonal forms, template sentences, coordinated constituents, nominalizations, and conventional text plans. Standard genre models and writing features from “core” academic communities coexist with alternative and traditional ways of writing and of disseminating knowledge, which is typical of a semiperipheral non-native English-speaking community torn between conflicting language and cultural paradigms. These contrasting tendencies are linked to identity changes within the community, as APL authors try to achieve international recognition by publishing abstracts in English as a Foreign Language.

The ASN is meant to attest that an individual has reached a suitable level of scientific maturity to apply for professorship positions. A five member panel, appointed for each scientific discipline, is in charge of evaluating applicants by means of quantitative indicators of impact and productivity, and through an assessment of their research profile. Many concerns were raised on the appropriateness of the evaluation criteria, and in particular on the use of bibliometrics for the evaluation of individual researchers. Additional concerns were related to the perceived poor quality of the final evaluation reports. In this paper we assess the ASN in terms of appropriateness of the applied methodology, and the quality of the feedback provided to the applicants. We argue that the ASN is not fully compliant with the best practices for the use of bibliometric indicators for the evaluation of individual researchers; moreover, the quality of final reports varies

This study focuses on Portuguese reference schools for the education of blind and partially sighted students, regulated by the Decree-Law No. 3/2008, in which are concentrated the human and material resources that can offer an educational response with quality for these students with special education needs. The study intends to analyse the perceptions of the teachers, who teach visually impaired students in middle school and secondary school education in these reference schools, of their knowledge, teaching and training in the area of ICT, as well as of the real ICT integration in the teaching and learning of these students. A survey, which has been applied to these teachers in the 2012/13 school year, was adopted as a method of data collection. The results reveal a sample confident in their technological capabilities, however with little resourcefulness in some tools and software specific to the area of visual impairment and a very significant number of teachers ignoring many of these. The implementation of ICT with students who have visual disabilities is lower compared with the sighted students. The lack of specific training is considered to be the main obstacle for teachers, with regard to the real integration of ICT in the teaching and learning of these students. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Assistive technology; Information and communication technologies; Portugal; Teacher training; Visual impairment,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ramos, S.I.M.; CEDH – Centre for Studies in Human Development, Rua Diogo Botelho, 1327, Portugal; email: saramramos@gmail.com",,Springer New York LLC,13602357,,,,English,Educ.

An online questionnaire was created in late September 2014 for the researchers working at the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics. 117 astrophysicists have revealed their attitudes and behaviour towards some major professional social networks (ResearchGate, LinkedIn, Academia) as well as their opinions about aspects of the main validation practices. The results show that professional social networks have been adopted widely (∼66%). ResearchGate results to be the most popular tool, followed by LinkedIn.

This study measures the degree of compliance with a Spanish government OA mandate 2.5 years after its implementation. A total of 58.4% of articles resulting from publicly funded research had at least one OA copy available 1 year after publication. Among these, 23.8% were in gold OA, 21.8% in green OA and 12.8% in gray OA, i.e., posted on websites and social networks. Most of the green OA articles were in 2 disciplinary repositories: arXiv and PubMed Central. Just 14.4% of the articles resulting from publicly funded research were available in institutional repositories, although more than 90% of the articles in the data set were the result of projects carried out at institutions that have such an archive. There is great potential for growth in green OA, because over two thirds of the articles that were not available as OA were published in journals whose publishers allow a preprint or a postprint copy to be deposited. © 2015 ASIS&T.",scholarly communication,Gold; Information services; Data set; Institutional repositories; Open Access; Scholarly communication; Societies and institutions,,,,,,,,,,,,"Borrego, Á.; Facultat de Biblioteconomia i Documentació, Spain; email: borrego@ub.edu",,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,23301635,,,,English,J.

A cross-sectional field test of the Spanish version of the CHLT (CHLT-30-DKspa) was conducted among healthy Latinos in Louisiana. Diagonally weighted least squares was used to confirm the factor structure. Item response analysis using 2-parameter logistic estimates was used to identify questions that may require modification to avoid bias. Cronbachs alpha coefficients estimated scale internal consistency reliability. Analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences in CHLT-30-DKspa scores by gender, origin, age and education. The mean CHLT-30-DKspa score (N = 400) was 17.13 (range = 0-30, SD = 6.65). Results confirmed a unidimensional structure, χ2(405) = 461.55, p =.027, comparative fit index =.993, Tucker-Lewis index =.992, root mean square error of approximation =.0180. Cronbachs alpha was.88.

The objective of this article is to conduct a comparative analysis of the regional television news programs in order to create an index that establishes the degree of quality for each news service. Four Spanish regional channels were analyzed: the Canary Islands Radio Televisión Canaria (RTVC), the Balearic Islands-Televisió de les Illes Balears (IB3), Castile and León's Castilla y León Televisión (CyLTV), and Navarre's Navarra Televisión (NaTV). Using the acquired data, we developed an indicator for political representation (R) and an indicator for the value of news frames (E). The combination of both indicators allows for the detection of anomalous behaviors when representing political parties. Our results show that there is a general tendency to positively represent all parties and to positively over-represent those parties that are not in the governing majority. However, in regional news programs where one party has an absolute majority in parliament, this tendency is smaller.",Informative quality; News frames; News services; Parliamentary representation; Spanish regional televisions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,El Profesional de la Informacion,13866710,,,,Spanish,Prof. Inf.,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958614948

A great number of authors have agreed that the origin of knowledge is embedded in the learning process. Following this line of thought, a proposal is advanced for a model on knowledge creation, based on organizational learning. This model is based on two processes: (1) the development of learning environments, which is performed by means of specific interventions in the learning process; and (2) the impulse for knowledge interaction, achieved by means of knowledge exchange or transfer within the organization (among workers) and between organizations (through cooperation agreements). This paper analyses the processes of knowledge transfer within companies operating in the Rioja wine sector, in two selected areas.

It has focused on the academic offer, which represents 46.35 per cent of the degrees presented in 2009, belonging to 90.16 per cent of Spanish universities. Findings – The results reveal predominance of incipient and reactive practices, oriented to the tactical level. During the adaptation process, these practices evolved due to the perception of the involvement of universities in the adaptation process. In addition, the proposed theoretical framework could be a tool to study CI both in other university management areas and other kind of organisations. Research limitations/implications – This research has been applied only to a critic incident: the design of university academic offer to be adapted to the EHEA. More studies about CI practices in other areas of universities should be done, using the same framework proposed in this study. Practical implications – This framework based on research done in business sector can be applied to any kind or organisations, including NGO and public sectors. Originality/value – Management tools used in the business sector, such as CI, have been adopted by Higher Educations Institutions, but while CI has been studied in depth in the business sector, it has scarcely been studied in higher education. This framework can be applied to any kind or organisations. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Competitive intelligence; Economical intelligence; EHEA; Environmental scanning; Higher education sector; Strategic planning,Competition; Competitive intelligence; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Surveys; Design/methodology/approach; Economical intelligence; EHEA; Environmental scanning; European higher education area (EHEA); Higher education; Semi structured interviews; Theoretical framework; Education,,,,,,,,,,,,"Garcia-Alsina, M.; Universitat Oberta de CatalunyaSpain; email: mgarciaals@uoc.edu",,Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,20503806,,,,English,Aslib J.

Within a context of growing globalisation, the acquisition and creation of knowledge is one of the main objectives sought with international expansion. The consideration of intellectual capital within the knowledge creation process in subsidiaries offers an innovative way to undertake knowledge management practices in multinationals. Theoretical and empirical works can be found in the literature about intellectual capital. However, very few studies link intellectual capital to knowledge creation in multinationals. Seeking to fill this gap, the purpose of this paper is to develop and test a model that includes the main intangibles belonging to structural and relational capital that can influence knowledge creation in Spanish subsidiaries of foreign multinational firms belonging to high-technology and knowledge-intensive sectors.

This article aims at laying the foundations for a comprehensive study of the research performance of SSH Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) researchers from a micro-level perspective. Both the Web of Science (WoS) and an internal CSIC database ('ConCiencia') are used in combination with a set of indicators describing the activity profile of researchers and the prestige of publication channels. Differences between the publication patterns of researchers in both domains are examined and so is the relationship between their research performance and their personal features. For researchers in humanities, the higher their academic rank and age the greater their activity in books and non-WoS articles was found to be; whereas for those working in the social sciences fields, a higher academic rank does not prefigure whether a researcher's scientific activity is more likely to be national or international in scope. Finally, a series of recommendations to consider output beyond the boundaries of WoS articles, and develop more accurate indicators for assessing the prestige of publication channels is expounded. © The Author 2016.

For this purpose, data from staff, finances, and services provided by the 47 public university libraries during 2008-2014 have been analyzed. Overall, the analysis of the data leads us to assert the following observations: these libraries have experienced a reduction in staff and expenditures for the purchase of information resources, whereas the volume of library lending has matched the evolution of student enrollment. Both interlibrary lending and the number of days that libraries were open during this period have decreased. Expenditures on electronic resources made by libraries and library consortia have increased in the period under study to the detriment of expenditures on monographs and printed journals.

We have structured the Web 2.0 Index as the sum of three partial indexes, referred to presence, the content and the interactivity of the Web, and we have estimated these indexes by a content analysis of the city council's websites. We find that the use of Web 2.0 tools has an essentially ornamental focus, and thus it is necessary to increase the content disclosed, especially at the information level. The results also show that, although there is a positive relationship between the Web 1.0 information transparency and the presence of the city councils on social media, and their intensity of use, the effect on transparency is basically ornamental, focused on general information. We also find that those city councils that obtain better Web 1.0 scores also have higher scores in the Web 2.0 setting, but are more focused on promotional issues than on the disclosure of information about the entities' management. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Digital transparency; E-government; Internet disclosure; Local government; Social media; Spain; Web 2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Huguet, D.; Department of Accounting, Avda.

This not only means that new media is changing the nature of listeners/viewers, transforming them into interactive users, but also that radio publics, once organized into networks, may have different properties, different behaviours and different values. In this paper, we have employed Digital Methods (DM) (Rogers, R. [2009]. The end of the virtual. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press) and social network analysis to understand the Twitter activity and the communicative dynamics of the audiences of two Italian national radio stations: Radio3 Rai (public service station) and Radio Deejay (private commercial station). This work also aims to respond to a question asked by Rogers when defining DM: ‘Could the information contained in profiles on social networking sites provide different insights into the composition and characteristics of publics?’ (Rogers, R. [2009]. The end of the virtual. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press). Based on the results that have emerged from this study, we believe that the answer can be affirmative: the analysis of the social connections and the interaction models of the networked listeners highlights new features of these audiences, and allows us to reevaluate and understand them from new points of view. This work shows that the digital audiences related to the two radio stations clearly distinguish themselves for their distinctive online behaviour and a different display of social networks, cultural capital and affect. We therefore hypothesize the presence of three different types of capital within the two different audiences analysed: social, cultural and affective capital. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",audience studies; digital methods; Media studies; network analysis; social media; sociology,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bonini, T.; Arts and Media Department, IULM University of MilanItaly",,Routledge,1369118X,,,,English,Inf.

With this proliferation in measurement of health literacy in research, it has become increasingly important to understand how various health literacy tools perform in specific populations. Our objective was to compare the performance of two widely used tests, the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA) and the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) among and between a sample of English and Spanish-speaking patients. Adults (N = 402) ages 50-75 years participating in a trial to promote colorectal cancer screening completed in-person interviews which included both measures of health literacy. In the full sample, the tests were moderately correlated (r = 0.69, p <.0001); however, there was a stronger correlation among those completing the test in Spanish (r = 0.83) as compared with English (r = 0.58, p <.0001). English speakers more often were categorized as having adequate literacy by the S-TOFHLA as compared with the NVS, whereas Spanish speakers scored consistently low on both instruments. These findings indicate that the categorization of participants into levels of literacy is likely to vary, depending on whether the NVS or S-TOFHLA is used for assessment, a factor which researchers should be aware of when selecting literacy assessments. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,aged; clinical trial; colorectal tumor; comparative study; early cancer diagnosis; education; female; health literacy; health promotion; human; language; male; middle aged; procedures; qualitative research; reproducibility; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Educational Measurement; Female; Health Literacy; Health Promotion; Humans; Language; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Reproducibility of Results,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: R01CA140177",,,,,,,,,,,"Ramirez-Zohfeld, V.; Division of General Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, 750 N.

Sentiment in Twitter for key politicians broadly reflects the main official polls for popularity but not for voting intention. In addition, the data suggests that the primary role of Twitter in politics is to select and amplify political events published by traditional media. © The Author(s) 2015.",Political analysis; sentiment analysis; Twitter,Sentiment analysis; Detection accuracy; Detection system; Linguistic phenomena; Political analysis; Political decision; Political events; Real time analysis; Twitter; Social networking (online),"Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, MECD: FPU13/01180; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: FFI2014-51978-C2; Xunta de Galicia: R2014/034","This research is partially supported by the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (FFI2014-51978-C2) and Xunta de Galicia (R2014/034).

This is especially relevant since the modern era, where the engineers who built and assaulted city defenses recorded the events with diverse documentation, including reports, diagrams, and maps. A large number of these sources contain spatial and temporal information, but it is difficult to integrate them into a common research framework due to its heterogeneity. In this context, geographical information science provides the necessary tools to explore an interdisciplinary analysis of these military actions. This article proposes a new approach to the study of sieges using a spatiotemporal formal model capable of integrating cartography, archaeological, and textual primary sources and terrain information. Its main aim is to show how concrete research questions and hypotheses can be explored using a formal model of this type of historical events. The methodology is applied to a particular case study: the French–Spanish siege of Barcelona that occurred in 1714. The protagonists faithfully recorded the development of the action, providing essential information for the model. Besides, different authors depicted the event as the paradigm of a city siege. For this reason, the model is also used to explore why real actions deviated from theoretical guidelines, clearly defined in different manuals. We use this scenario to explore two issues: (a) why the attackers chose to assault a particular city sector and (b) the factors that explain the casualties of the besiegers. We conclude that we need methodological tools capable of integrating heterogeneous information to improve the understanding of siege warfare that affected not only military conflict but also the shape of European urban landscapes. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",Geographical information science; Military history; Spatial analysis; Vauban; War of the Spanish Succession,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: XRC is part of the SimulPast Project (CSD2010-00034) funded by the CONSOLIDER-INGENIO2010 program of the Ministry of Science and Innovation – Spain.",,,,,,,,,,"Rubio-Campillo, X.; Barcelona Supercomputing Center—Computer Applications for Science & Engineering, 2-4, Nexus 1, Room 202, Spain; email: xavier.rubio@bsc.es",,SAGE Publications Inc.,8944393,,,,English,Soc.

Independent variables included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, health literacy, health beliefs, and self-efficacy. Spanish speakers had lower health literacy and poorer physical, mental, and overall health compared to English speakers. Higher health literacy was associated with less social support for diet, fewer diet and medication barriers, younger age, higher diabetes knowledge, and talking with health care professionals to get diabetes information. In contrast to expectations, health literacy was not associated with diabetes self-care, health status, or satisfaction with communication, and it did not mediate the effects of other factors on these outcomes. Diabetes self-efficacy was significantly associated with health behaviors and outcomes.

Individuals and organizations produce and collect a broad range of different types of data in order to perform their tasks. Governments are particularly significant in this respect, not only because of the quantity and centrality of the data they collect, but also because most government data are public data by law and, therefore, could be made openly available for public use. Despite a growing consensus that Open Government in general and Open Data in particular are good both for governments and for society at large, there is no clear way to enable empirical analysis and quantitative measurements of Open Government Data initiatives. Our research uses a holistic approach proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that includes all stages in the deployment of an Open Government Data initiative, namely strategy, implementation, organization, communication, interaction, and Impact. The analysis shows that Spanish municipalities can be divided into three groups: municipalities that are performing reasonably well (A), municipalities that are doing something but not as much as the first group (B), and municipalities that are doing very little or almost nothing (C). The research also draws two basic similarities between groups A and B and two types of differences between them. Another conclusion is that the different dimensions explain partly (more than the 72% of the variance) the difference between actual and expected performances supporting indirectly the OECD’s framing and the probable existence of a pathway toward successful Open Government Data projects. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",local government; Open Data; Open Government; public policy evaluation; smart city,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Carrasco, C.; IESE Business School, Av.

Given TCs’ main function, most authors present an industrial perspective of their performance. However, the bibliometric techniques can offer not only an overview of these centres, but also additional information about their features: the evolution of their publications, the degree of national and international collaboration, the Spanish institutional sectors and the main disciplines involved, the regional differences and their connections. In this article, Spanish TCs’ documents downloaded from the Web of Science (2008–2012) are analysed, along with other indicators that can characterise these centres. The results show that national collaboration is important for TCs and even more when those links are local. This is in line with that stated by other authors, considering that geographical proximity is essential for knowledge transfer. Regarding the Spanish institutional sectors, the strongest relations are established with universities. For their part, firms have low participation in publications, although they show an upward trend over the years. Nevertheless, TCs’ documents are mainly issued on industrial related topics, in agreement with their primary mission as promoters of firms’ innovation.

It is not just communities that are grappling with the pain of the economic downturn; libraries are also suffering from the crisis as a result of budget cuts due to reduced public funding. This article presents the case of Spanish academic and public libraries that have found solutions to keep themselves open, providing services vital to the economic and sociocultural needs of their communities. This case is an example of contributive justice, as evidenced in the actions taken by Spanish libraries and their communities as well as in the manner in which the research data were collected. Eight libraryrelated actions were found: professional, community, social, political, digital, cultural/heritage, economic, and ontological. Despite economic hardships all around, these Spanish examples reveal the impact of libraries as social justice institutions, the role of librarians as agents of change, and the value of contributive and grassroots efforts when governments fail to provide. Moreover, these contributions to social justice illustrate actions appropriate to a contributive justice framework for libraries, as proposed in this article. © 2015 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Johns Hopkins University Press,242594,,,,English,Libr.

Therefore, this study focuses on how online shopping via Facebook, peer recommendations, and website service quality affect consumer trust, attitudes and loyalty intentions in e-tailing. An online survey was conducted with Generation Y Italian consumers who used Facebook searches of various websites to shop for clothing online. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to validate the constructs, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypotheses. Findings confirm that website service quality and consumers' predispositions to use Facebook for online shopping directly and positively affect consumer trust toward an e-tailer. In contrast, peer recommendations affect attitude directly rather than indirectly via trust. The results further indicate that peer recommendations have a significantly stronger influence on attitudes of females than they do on attitudes of males. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the amount, type, web impact and topology of the AWDs in commercial companies in order to get a better understanding on their complete web impact and structure. Design/methodology/approach - The set of companies belonging to the Spanish IBEX-35 stock index has been analysed as testing bench. The authors proceeded to identify and categorise all AWDs belonging to these companies, and to apply both web impact (web presence and visibility) and network metrics. Findings - The results show that AWDs get a high web presence but relatively low web visibility, due to certain opacity or less dissemination of some AWDs favoring its isolation. This is verified by the low network density values obtained, that occur because AWDs are strongly connected with the corporate domain (although asymmetrically), but very weakly linked each other. Research limitations/implications - The categories used to classify the various AWD, although they are clearly distinguishable conceptually, have certain limitations in practice, since they depend on the form adopted by companies to publish certain content or to provide certain services or products. Otherwise, the use of web indicators presents certain problems of accuracy that could be softened if applied with caution and in a relational basis. Originality/value - Although the processes of AWDs creation and categorisation are complex (web policy seems not to be driven by a defined or conscious plan), their influence on the web performance of IBEX 35 companies is meaningful.

To this end, we downloaded all the Spanish publications from the Web of Science databases, in the subject categories of Gastroenterology/Hepatology and Psychiatry during the period 2008-2011. Our results showed that, taken alone, the dataset based on addresses identified more than 60% of all potential CIBER publications. However, the best outcome was obtained by combining it with additional datasets based on funding acknowledgements and on authors, recovering more than 80% of all possible CIBER publications without losing accuracy. In terms of bibliometric performance, all the CIBER sets showed scores above the country average, thus proving the relevance of these virtual organisations. Finally, given the increasing importance of these structures and the fact that authors do not always mention their connection to CIBER, some recommendations are offered to develop clear policies on how, when and where to specify this relationship © 2015, Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Address analysis; Author analysis; Bibliometric data collection; Funding acknowledgements; Gastroenterology/Hepatology; Networking centres; Psychiatry,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Morillo, F.; Centre for Human and Social Sciences (CCHS), Albasanz 26-28, Spain; email: fernanda.morillo@cchs.csic.es",,Kluwer Academic Publishers,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027946045

But despite data that confirm this trend, little is known about the reasons why researchers decide to publish their results in English rather than in their first language. The aim of this study is to determine the influence of researchers’ scientific domain on their motivation to publish in English. The results are based on a large-scale survey of Spanish postdoctoral researchers at four different universities and one research centre, and reflect responses from 1717 researchers about their difficulties, motivations, attitudes and publication strategies. Researchers’ publication experiences as corresponding authors of articles in English and in their first language are strongly related to their scientific domain. But surprisingly, Spanish researchers across all domains expressed a similar degree of motivation when they write research articles in English. They perceive a strong association between this language and the desire for their research to be recognized and rewarded. Our study also shows that the target scientific audience is a key factor in understanding the choice of publication language.

According to the normative point of view, the behavior of scientists is regulated by norms that make the detection of citation patterns useful for the interpretation of bibliometric measures. According to the constructivist perspective, citer behavior is influenced by other factors linked to the social and/or psychological sphere that do not allow any statistical inferences that are useful for the purposes of interpretation. An intermediate position supports normative theories in describing citer behavior with respect to high citation frequencies and constructivist theories with respect to low citation counts. In this paper, this idea was tested in a case study of the Italian sociology community. Italian sociology is characterized by an unusual organization into three ""political"" or ""ideological"" camps, and belonging to one camp can be considered a potentially strong constructivist reason to cite. An all-author co-citation analysis was performed to map the structure of the Italian sociology community and look for evidence of three camps. We did not expect to find evidence of this configuration in the co-citation map. The map, in fact, included authors who obtained high citation counts that are supposedly produced by a normative-oriented behavior. The results confirmed this hypothesis and showed that the clusters seemed to be divided according to topic and not by camp. Relevant scientific works were cited by the members of the entire community regardless of their membership in any particular camp. © 2014 ASIS&T.",citation analysis,Information analysis; Pattern recognition; Social sciences; Bibliometric; Bibliometrics; Citation analysis; Co-Citation Analysis; Cocitation; Normative theory; Scientometrics; Statistical inference; Behavioral research,,,,,,,,,,,,"Riviera, E.; Department of Sociology, Sweden; email: e.riviera@campus.unimib.it",,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,23301635,,,,English,J.

Where D'Angelo's text differs is in how his memoir details an existential dilemma shaped by fruitless labor. Like the ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus, who is condemned to roll a rock on top of a mountain only to see such object roll back down, D'Angelo's struggle as a laborer in his new land becomes a similar absurd quest. This absurd struggle, however, also adds a rich layer to D'Angelo's narrative. Similar to the way French author Albert Camus writes about Sisyphus in ""The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays,"" D'Angelo's immigrant experience makes him an early ""Spokesman for the Absurd."" Yet as many struggle to find gainful, sustaining employment today, can an early 20th century narrative about one Italian's journey to America and his often fruitless efforts to sustain himself as a ""pick-and-shovel man,"" also address the dilemma for labor in the early 21st century? Despite D'Angelo's ""Sisyphean"" attempt at finding meaningful employment, this immigrant who broke American soil with his pick and shovel for less than sustaining wages, still managed to pen a rich and dynamic memoir that deserves a much wider audience. © Common Ground, Kenneth DiMaggio, Carl Antonucci, All Rights Reserved.",Existentialism; Italian-American; Myth of Sisyphus; Pascal D'Angelo; Son of Italy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Common Ground Research Networks,14479516,,,,English,Int.

These data specifications include the technical documentation of the application schema that defines the content and structure of the data required by one or more applications. Cultural heritage also overlaps the Data Specification on Buildings, for architectural heritage is to be taken as constructed buildings under that data specification. Nonetheless, manyheritage features do not fit within the definition of a building. The Cultural Heritage Application Schema developed by IDEE (Infraestructuras de Datos Espaciales) [Spatial Data Infrastructures] Working Group suggests the inclusion of cultural heritage protected areas as a special kind of protected site, and develops a minimal schema to include information about the real world protected entity.

However, the literature lacks discussion on this type of intervention. This randomized control trial aimed to test the feasibility of using conventional English-as-a-second-language (ESL) instruction for improving health literacy among Spanish-speaking adults. Objectives included the development, implementation, and evaluation of a health literacy/ESL curriculum. The Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) in English was used to assess health literacy levels. Analyses included independent sample t test, chi-square, and multiple linear regression. A total of 155 people participated. Results showed a significantly higher increase in the TOFHLA posttest score in the intervention group (p =.01), and noticeable differences in health literacy levels between groups. Results indicate that ESL constitutes a promising venue for improving health literacy among Spanish-speaking adults. Incorporating health literacy-related content may provide additional benefits.

The first round of the ASN received 59,149 applications, and the results have been made publicly available for a short period of time, including the values of the quantitative indicators for each applicant. The availability of this wealth of information provides an opportunity to draw a fairly detailed picture of a nation-wide evaluation exercise, and to study the impact of the bibliometric indicators on the qualification results. In this paper, we provide a first account of the Italian National Scientific Qualification from a quantitative point of view. We show that significant differences exist among scientific disciplines, in particular with respect to the fraction of qualified applicants, that cannot be easily explained. Furthermore, we describe some issues related to the definition and use of the bibliometric indicators and the corresponding thresholds. Our analysis aims at drawing attention to potential problems that should be addressed by decision-makers in future rounds of the ASN. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",ASN; Bibliometrics; Italy; National Scientific Qualification; Research evaluation,ASN; Bibliometrics; Italy; National Scientific Qualification; Research evaluation; Decision making,,,,,,,,,,,,"Marzolla, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, mura Anteo Zamboni 7, Italy; email: moreno.marzolla@unibo.it",,Elsevier Ltd,17511577,,,,English,J.

Design/methodology/approach – A sample of 28 historical star catalogues (eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries) from the Royal Institute and Observatory of the Spanish Navy was selected in order to analyse their structure and to identify information patterns. Findings – The analysis shows that there are a number of technical parameters which are not present in the cataloguing standards and which should be taken into account in the bibliographic descriptions of these specialised documents since they are of great interest to astronomers and astrophysicists. On the other hand, star catalogues provide some cartographic information which can be described by these standards but whose corresponding fields are not widely used by cataloguers. Originality/value – A proposal of new technical parameters is given in order to try to improve the bibliographic records of these astronomical resources. Some directions are also given in order to identify the sections of the catalogues where these parameters may be found, making the task of locating them easier. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Astronomical information retrieval; Cartographic resources; Cataloguing quality; Cataloguing standards; Royal institute and observatory of the Spanish navy; Star catalogues,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lifante, M.P.A.; Information and Documentation, Spain; email: mp.alonsolifante@gmail.com",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,220418,,,,English,J.

Furthermore, the increasing social concern about establishing procedures of accountability and ensuring information transparency in public universities prompted us to consider the need to disclose information on their IC. In this study, we developed a questionnaire that was sent to members of the Social Councils of Spanish public universities in order to identify the intangible elements about which university stakeholders demand most information. It was also used to see which groups of universities have stakeholders who are more proactive to the disclosure of IC. Our results represent a starting point for public universities to identify the most commonly requested information about IC. Universities can then develop an IC report that fits their own characteristics and environment. © 2015 Operational Research Society.

The library was composed of one collection. The methodology used is grounded on the principals of usability tests of digital libraries' websites where users (students) develop processes and give feedback regarding the environment. Usage was measured taking into account these four factors: Effectiveness, Efficiency, Satisfaction and Usefulness. Results showed high perception of efficiency and effectiveness when carrying out browsing and searching activities. The only aspect showing difficulties has to do with the usage of the functions “Help” and “Preferences” in this course's web environment. Students reported a high degree of satisfaction with the use of the library, being the contents, the order and the searching ease, the aspects perceived with the highest value. Since digital libraries are relatively new resources, the need of presenting this resource at the beginning of the course to reach a higher rate of use and exploitation was evident. This experience suggests that the distribution of ex professo collections through digital libraries can be an effective way to provide learning resources to students and other users. © 2015 Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecologia.

The books available in bookshops fund future editions in such a way that profits grow from speeding up the rotation of titles in the shops; this entails the sacrifice of long-tail books as publishers are pushed to launch new titles to keep the bubble inflated. For seven years, demand has not matched supply, leading to lower profitability per unit. The average print run is also low, reducing gross margin, while returns are still growing and industrial prices are increasing faster than the retail price of books. The sector is currently suffering a severe cash crunch. Grupo Planeta and other big publishers face a crisis of falling sales, and a large volume of money is caught in the bubble, so that bookshops cannot afford to buy new books and publishers cannot take returns without feeding a vicious cycle. Current law does not permit the reduction of book prices to encourage shopping or facilitate innovative marketing techniques. This law puts effective control of the sector in the hands of private institutions that would prefer nothing to change. The consequence of this systemic crisis is likely to be industrial restructuring driven by public-sector-based exemptions and tax incentives, and adaptation of the legislation to make it more flexible. © 2015 Copyright 2015 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.",Andrew Wylie; Book Law; books; bookshops; bubble burst; Carmen Balcells; CEGAL; copyright; ebooks; economic crisis; FGEE; Grupo Planeta; Grupo Prisa; independent bookshops; Latin America; Libranda; Santillana; Spain; Spanish publishing industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ruiz, B.; Instituto de Postgrado de Estudios Culturales y de Comunicación (IPECC), United Kingdom; email: 1mes1iguala3@telefonica.net",,Brill Academic Publishers,9579656,,,,English,Logos,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039149979

First of all, the main types of astronomical resources are defined focusing on their historical evolution. Secondly, the result of a survey carried out between April and May 2014 about the astronomical collections in Spanish map libraries and archives is shown taking as a reference the IBERCARTO directory of 2012. Conclusions show that almost half of queried libraries and archives map have these type of documents, but disseminated in different collections. Moreover, around 70% of the institutions have catalogued all of their astronomical documentation and have used the classical encoding (MARC 21) and cataloguing standards (ISBD and ISAD(G)), although recent studies have shown that these standards are not the most suitable ones to describe it.

These conflicts of interest threaten the integrity of research, the objectivity of medical education, the quality of patient care and, more generally, public confidence in medicine. A strategy to protect research integrity and maintain public trust is for authors to communicate their possible conflicts of interest in the studies they publish. This paper analyses the editorial policies of the 16 clinically oriented biomedical journals published in Spain that were included in the JCR in 2011, in relation to authors' conflict of interest declarations. Results show that, in their instructions to authors, most journals mention the need to disclose possible conflicts of interest and offer some sort of description of such situations. However, the definitions are lax concerning which economic relations should be declared and do not specify the extent of personal relationships. In most cases there is no standard form for declaring conflicts of interest; there is no indication of the period of time during which a relationship can be considered likely to generate a conflict; there is no indication of who will evaluate these statements and how they will be evaluated; and there is no indication as to whether these statements will be published in the articles. © 2015 CSIC.",Clinical journals; Conflicts of interest; Editorial policies; pharmaceutical industry,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Roig, F.; Universitat de Barcelona, Facultat de Biblioteconomia i DocumentacióBrazil",,Spanish Research Council,2100614,,,,Spanish,Rev.

Usually references are broken down by type of cited literature, but we do it in a more original way: by type of cited institution. We focus on universities and compare Spain with the European Union 27 at national, regional and institutional levels. Access to public knowledge in Spain is similar to the overall European trends: highly internationalised with American universities being the most accessed. But Spain presents some idiosyncrasies: infrequent access to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and frequent access to Dutch and Israeli universities. Also access to universities from the same region occurs more often than in other Member States (especially in regions other than Madrid). In reference to the situation in other EU members, access to Spanish universities from Germany is relatively low and the only university with citations above the European average is the Autonomous University of Madrid. We offer policymakers some recommendations for modifying these characteristics according to certain desirability criteria. © 2015 CSIC.",Knowledge flows; Patents; citations; University-technology links,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Azagra Caro, J.M.; INGENIO (CSIC-UPV)Spain",,Spanish Research Council,2100614,,,,Spanish,Rev.

This activity is multidimensional and its different dimensions may be unduly influenced by the economic context in which it is carried out. The present work analyses the research activity of Spanish public universities in the context of per capita GDP of their territories. The work examines data from 2002-2010 obtained from the IUNE observatory. The relationship between GDP and the different dimensions of research activity are analyzed: recognition, scientific activity, innovation, competitiveness and research training capacity. The results show that the economic context in which the activity takes place is not neutral and that there are significant correlations and linear relationships between per capita GDP and various dimensions of research activity. The significance is particularly notable once the dimensions are relativized according to the number of inhabitants. Statistically significant differences have also been found for different dimensions of research activity between universities located in territories with higher, or lower, per capita GDP. © 2014 CSIC.",Competitiveness and GDP; Dimensions of research activity; R&D and GDP in spain; Research and GDP; Research training capacity and GDP; Scientific activity and GDP,,"Merck; Roche; Gilead Sciences; AbbVie; Russian Science Foundation, RSF","Dr. Marina R.

Currently, communication skills are indispensable to students in expanding their social networks and their knowledge at university and in the future workplace, since businesses expect their employees to have strong communication and presentation skills. This paper provides empirical evidence based on the anonymous quantitative and qualitative data collected during 2 years from 126 postgraduate students, which were collected via formal and informal feedback. Various assessment methods were used in Information Systems units to promote and develop the communication skills; these assessments are: reflective journal, business plan and prototype, discussion forum, presentation, and final examination. A Communication skills model (CSM) was developed based on Action research principles to promote the assessments which will assist IS students to enhance their communication skills. The research outcomes indicated that integrating communication skills in the assessments will allow students to promote their communication skills and boost their self-esteem skills. Furthermore, this paper added a new theoretical and practical contribution to higher-education teaching and learning literature, especially the action research for teachers to promote and develop communication skills among students.

This study aimed to analyze the content and form of news items related to mental illness in Spanish newspapers in order to understand their role in propagating or attenuating stereotypes, prejudices, and stigma. The authors conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study on the basis of a review of news items related to mental illness appearing in the Spanish print media. A sample was taken from articles published on the subject in the 20 Spanish newspapers with the widest circulations over the course of the year 2010. Formal elements and content were analyzed by means of a structured evaluation system. The authors analyzed 695 news items. The content of 47.9% (n = 333) of the articles was not strictly related to mental illness, but rather clinical or psychiatric terms were used metaphorically, and frequently in a pejorative sense. The remaining 52.1% (n = 362) consisted of news items related specifically to mental illness. Of these, news items linking mental illness to danger were the most common (178 texts, 49.2%), specifically those associating mental illness with violent crime (130 texts, 35.9%) or a danger to others (126 texts, 34.8%). The results confirm the hypothesis that the press treats mental illness in a manner that encourages stigmatization. The authors appeal to the press's responsibility to society and advocate an active role in reducing the stigma towards mental illness. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"cross-sectional study; human; mental disease; psychology; publication; publishing; social stigma; Spain; statistics and numerical data; stereotyping; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Journalism, Medical; Mental Disorders; Newspapers; Social Stigma; Spain; Stereotyping",,,,,,,,,,,,"Aragonès, E.; Centre D'Atenció Primària de Constantý, Carrer dels Horts 6, Spain",,"Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.",10810730,,,24708534,English,J.

The study aimed (a) to evaluate measurement equivalence of Health Literacy Assessment Using Talking Touchscreen Technology (Health LiTT) and (b) to compare Health LiTT scores between English-and Spanish-speaking individuals. Health LiTT and several patient-reported outcome instruments were completed by adult patients receiving care for type 2 diabetes at a safety net clinic. English-Spanish measurement equivalence was evaluated with an item response theory approach to differential item functioning (DIF) detection and impact. Health LiTT scores were compared by language using multivariable linear regression. Approximately equal numbers of English-speaking patients (n = 146) and Spanish-speaking patients (n = 149) with type 2 diabetes were enrolled. English participants were primarily non-Hispanic Black (65%); all Spanish participants were Hispanic. Six Health LiTT items were flagged for DIF. The Pearson correlation between unadjusted and DIF adjusted scores was 0.995; the mean difference of individual difference scores was 0.0005 (SD = 0.0888). After adjusting for predisposing characteristics, enabling resources and need for care, Health LiTT scores were comparable for Spanish-speaking individuals versus English-speaking individuals. The effect of DIF items on Health LiTT scores appeared to be trivial.

One of them has to do with the inability to accurately represent national university systems as their original purpose is only to rank world-class universities. Another one has to do with the lack of representativeness of universities’ disciplinary profiles as they usually provide a unique table. Although some rankings offer a great coverage and others offer league tables by fields, no international ranking does both. In order to surpass such limitation from a research policy viewpoint, this paper analyzes the possibility of using national rankings in order to complement international rankings. For this, we analyze the Spanish university system as a study case presenting the I-UGR Rankings for Spanish universities by fields and subfields. Then, we compare their results with those obtained by the Shanghai Ranking, the QS Ranking, the Leiden Ranking and the NTU Ranking, as they all have basic common grounds which allow such comparison. We conclude that it is advisable to use national rankings in order to complement international rankings, however we observe that this must be done with certain caution as they differ on the methodology employed as well as on the construction of the fields. © 2014, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",International rankings; National rankings; Research evaluation; Spain; Universities,,,Acknowledgments Thanks are due to the two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

The diffusion of e-readers and tablets has led to a spate of pirated copies of books. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed model holds that normative and value consciousness, as well as the self-efficacy, the usefulness and the use of the new technology, are determinants of the trend towards free downloads and the maximum acceptable price for e-books. Data are collected from a sample of 227 users of e-book reader devices. Findings - The results provide evidence that individuals are inclined towards piracy when they use and control the technology, whereas value consciousness mitigates illegal downloading and is basic to the individuals' acceptance of a higher price. Implications - Bearing in mind that the spread of electronic devices has led to an increase in downloads, raising awareness of the norms among individuals is essential if piracy is to be curtailed. In addition, actions aimed at endowing electronic books with value would encourage consumers to pay a higher price for them. Originality/value - Few attempts have been made to apply ethics theories and the technology acceptance model to the context of e-books' piracy, and even less effort has been devoted to analyse consumers' price acceptance in the e-book industry. © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",E-books; Piracy; Price acceptance; Technology acceptance,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Camarero, C.; Department of Business Administration and Marketing, Spain; email: camarero@eco.uva.es",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,2640473,,ELLID,,English,Electron.

It explores whether demographics and academic factors might influence e-book reading habits and attitudes and university students' opinions about e-books vs print books. REWIL 2.0, a purpose-built research tool, was applied to measure students' opinions about digital reading in different media and formats, considering their academic context, at the confluence of analog and digital materials and learning. Likewise, REWIL 2.0 detects who are e-book readers (eBR) and who are not and produces a statistics indicator to identify five categories of eBRs by their frequency of e-book reading. This research gathered 745 online surveys between April and July 2010 in 15 degree programs at the University of Granada: Spanish philology, English philology, history, mathematics, chemistry, environmental sciences, education, library and information science, law, medicine, biology, dentistry, computer systems, architecture and civil engineering. Design/methodology/approach - This present study is a transversal applied research, where 745 students were surveyed from 15 different academic disciplines offered at the University of Granada (Spain), representing the five main discipline areas. The survey was carried out by means of a structured online survey, with REWIL 2.0 research tool. To ensure internal consistency of correlation between two different survey items designed to measure e-book reading frequency, Pearson's r reliability test was applied. Likewise, Persons' chi-squared statistics were applied to test the hypotheses and to detect if significant correlation existed between academic disciplines and e-book reading frequency measured through a Likert scale. Findings - The present research is motivated by our interest in discovering what effect the current technological maelstrom and the rapid growth of new portable digital reading devices in the Spanish university environment are having on students' lives, and the extent to which students have adopted new reading technologies. Their first aim is to establish who is reading e-books in the University? A second aim is to answer the following question: is the academic discipline a determinant factor in e-book reading habits and students' attitudes about it? The authors began by considering the following hypotheses: University students' attitudes to e-book reading and the way they use them will be determined by the scientific discipline they study. Students of humanities, social sciences and law will prefer to read traditional format books (printed paper), while students of experimental sciences, health and technical courses will prefer reading e-books. Students' preferences will be determined by their previous reading experiences. Originality/value - The main objective of the present study is to learn whether there are any notable differences among university students from distinct disciplines with regard to their attitude and behavior toward e-books. The authors, therefore, set out to identify the segment of the student population that does not read e-books yet (non-eBRs) from those who have already read at least one (eBRs), and within this segment, the readers that have read e-books recently (recent eBRs); find out how frequently university students are reading in different formats (paper and digital), document types (book, written press, etc.) and languages (textual, multimodal, etc.) identify what channels are used to access e-books; find out university students' opinions on the advantages and disadvantages of reading e-books as compared to traditional print books; and identify the types of improvements or changes to the design-production-distribution-reception chain that students consider might help extend e-book reading. © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Academic libraries; E-learning; Electronic books; Information literacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pinto, M.; Faculty of Communication and Information Science, Spain; email: mpinto@ugr.es",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,2640473,,ELLID,,English,Electron.

Secondly the study delves into the acquisitions procedure. It appears differentiated from selection, but at the same time, related to it. It is structured and standardized, and includes donations. Although principally linked to print publications, the results nonetheless are presented within the context of a hybrid library. © 2014 CSIC.",Acquisitions; Collection management; Plans; Regulations; Spain; University libraries,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Herrera-Morillas, J.L.; Universidad de Extremadura, Spain; email: jlhermor@unex.es",,,2100614,,,,Spanish,Rev.

Cross-sectional descriptive study is made, to evaluate the global quality, accessibility, usability, interactivity, updating, quality model and information given in 53 different websites belonging to Spanish hospitals with more than 500 beds. Only 22 (41.5%) of the websites analyzed fall into the upper half of the scale used. As such, the mean quality of these websites is shown to be low. On one hand, both accessibility and usability of the evaluated websites were notable, with specific sections for health professionals and hospital suppliers. On the other, the websites were characterized by a limited incorporation of tools for interacting with users, a poor presentation of information about health, diseases, waiting lists and care activities, as well as a deficient updating of their content and almost no adherence to quality references. In short, the websites of large Spanish hospitals are simple informational spaces that don't facilitate the interaction, participation and collaboration of hospital users. In conclusion, websites of large Spanish hospitals, in addition to being informative spaces, should facilitate more interaction, participation and collaboration with hospital users. © 2014 CSIC.",Accessibility; Content update; Hospital bed capacity 500 and over; Information technology; Interactivity; Internet; Quality evaluation; Usability; Websites,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Calvo-Calvo, M.-Á.; Departamento de Enfermería, Facultad de Enfermería, , Sevilla, Spain; email: macalvo@us.es",,,2100614,,,,Spanish,Rev.

Changes in content consumption habits are also highlighted, with special attention to adaptations to digital change. Facts 2012: the operating costs of Spanish libraries amounted to 990.1 million euros (+0.54% compared to 2010); if the increase in the CPI is taken into account, the cost increase is actually 5%.

The article discusses the complexity of interactions between international and domestic relations within and beyond formal structures of policy-making in amending the legal framework in Spain: First, European directives set the pace and context as well as the legitimacy to initiate policy reform at the national level. At the same time, it is the catalytic role of other external actors and specifically the U.S. Embassy in Spain and the 301 Special Report in steering and re-activating policy change towards a particular direction. Internal developments, a combination of reactions from an-unintended-public debate and opposition offered by leading cultural actors as well as change of government, caused challenges to the passing of the law. The main focus of Law Sinde, the Spanish IP law as it became known, was to tighten control around individual usage of copyrighted material. To facilitate this, its strategy was to control technological use by intervening on three distinct levels, on the level of the user, the level of institutions and the level of jurisdiction. The IP law change is not simply a case of national law, but one that highlights global governance interdependence and the struggle for hegemony among corporate, state and civil society interests © First Monday, 1995-2014..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sarikakis, K.; Media Industries, Media Organisation and Media Governance, Austria; email: katharine.sarikakis@univie.ac.at",,,13960466,,,,English,First Monday,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896866661

To address such disparities, health communication interventionists often face the challenge to adapt existing interventions from English into Spanish in a way that retains essential elements of the original intervention while also addressing the linguistic needs and cultural perspectives of the target population. The authors describe the conceptual framework, context, rationale, methods, and findings of a formative research process used in creating a Spanish-language version of an evidence-based (English language) multimedia colorectal cancer screening decision aid. The multistep process included identification of essential elements of the existing intervention, literature review, assessment of the regional context and engagement of key stakeholders, and solicitation of direct input from target population. The authors integrated these findings in the creation of the new adapted intervention. They describe how they used this process to identify and integrate sociocultural themes such as personalism (personalismo), familism (familismo), fear (miedo), embarrassment (verguenza), power distance (respeto), machismo, and trust (confianza) into the Spanish-language decision aid.

Data related to the annual research output of 81 public and private universities are shown, with a focus on collaborative institutional networks in six broad areas: Experimental Sciences; Engineering and Computer Sciences; Life Sciences; Medicine and Pharmacy; Social Sciences; Arts and Humanities. Through the visualization of co-authored works, the main institutions in each area are identified. The results show that the Spanish university system has produced 299,887 documents in 10 years with an increase of 200% between 2002 and 2011. Experimental Sciences was the area with the largest number of publications with almost 40% of the total. Collaboration profiles show that the university system changed from a model in which authorship from a single institution was the norm, to one in which international collaboration is the most prevalent. © 2014 CSIC.",Inter-university collaboration; Scientific productivity; Spanish university system; Universities; Web of science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Spanish Research Council,2100614,,,,Spanish,Rev.

This paper considers the role of José Casares Gil (1866-1961) for producing a historical study on the relation between research schools, scientific sites and scientific collaboration. José Casares ran several university and institutional laboratories, such as the central customs laboratory of Madrid, and the chemical analysis laboratories of the faculties of pharmacy in Barcelona and Madrid. These spaces allowed him to be in contact with many students, colleagues, industrialists and members of other institutions. By considering these spaces this paper will discuss whether Casares succeeded in creating a research school. © 2014 CSIC.",20th century; José Casares Gil; Schools of research; Scientific collaboration; Sites of chemistry; Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Suay-Matallana, I.; Instituto de Historia de la Medicina y de la Ciencia López Piñero (CSIC-UV)Spain",,Spanish Research Council,2100614,,,,English,Rev.

This research analyzes funding acknowledgment presence in scientific publications and introduces a novel approach for discovering text patterns by discipline in the acknowledgment section of papers. First, the presence of acknowledgments in 38,257 Englishlanguage papers published by Spanish researchers in 2010 is studied by subject area on the basis of the funding acknowledgment information available in the Webof Science database. Funding acknowledgments are present in two thirds of Spanish articles, with significant differences by subject area, number of authors, impact factor of journals, and, in one specific area, basic/applied nature of research. Second, the existence of specific acknowledgment patterns in English-language papers of Spanish researchers in 4 selected subject categories (cardiac and cardiovascular systems, economics, evolutionary biology, and statistics and probability) is explored through a combination of text mining and multivariate analyses. ""Peer interactive communication"" predominates in the more theoretical or social-oriented fields (statistics and probability, economics), whereas the recognition of technical assistance is more common in experimental research (evolutionary biology), and the mention of potential conflicts of interest emerges forcefully in the clinical field (cardiac and cardiovascular systems). The systematic inclusion of structured data about acknowledgments in journal articles and bibliographic databases would have a positive impact on the study of collaboration practices in science. © 2014 ASIS&T.",,Biology; Cardiovascular system; Data mining; Information services; Natural language processing systems; Bibliographic database; Collaboration practices; Experimental research; Interactive communications; Multi variate analysis; Scholarly communication; Scientific publications; Technical assistance; Publishing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,23301635,,,,English,J.

More specifically, the authors build on the intellectual capital-based view of the firm and new product development perspectives to analyse which intellectual capital elements affect product innovation performance at innovative small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from Portugal, and what are their interdependencies, if any, in that process. The findings confirm that intellectual capital does influence product innovation performance at Portuguese innovative SMEs. However, not all intellectual capital elements that were identified for the purpose of this research show such a relevant effect. In fact, only three elements, coming, respectively, from human, relational and structural capital, effectively reveal a significant impact on product innovation performance. Those are 'Commitment to the Product Innovation Process', 'Vertical Relationships' and 'Product Innovation Management and Strategy'. In addition, only structural capital elements exhibit a significant direct impact on product innovation success. Human capital and relational capital elements affect product innovation indirectly, through their interaction with structural capital. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of intellectual capital elements on product innovation at SMEs, providing more evidence on which to build an intellectual capital-based view of corporate phenomena. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.

There is evidence of inappropriate behaviours associated with several factors that call for a better regulation of the conditions in which authorship of a scientific work is assigned. This regulation falls within the competences of the associations of scientific publishers and the journals themselves. The aim of this paper is to analyse the situation of international policies and editorial practices of Spanish journals in the areas of Science and Technology. A transversal content analysis of the manuals of good practices in academic publishing and a sample of 37 Spanish prestigious journals was carried out, with special attention paid to the criteria for authorship, derived liabilities, the role of acknowledgements, number of authors, author ordering, and responsibilities of the corresponding author. The results give cause for concern: only 15% of the manuals and 8% of the journals manage to declare these criteria properly. We compare these results with those of other areas, such as Biomedicine, where similar studies have been carried out, and we discuss the impact of non-regulation on authors' behaviour and scientific ethics, as well as the implications of co-authorship in scholarly evaluation procedures. © 2014 CSIC.",Academic publishing manuals; Authorship; International policies; Science and technology; Scientific co-authorship; Scientific ethics; Scientific evaluation; Scientific journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ruíz-Pérez, R.; Departamento de Información y Documentación, Universidad de Granada, Campus de Cartuja s/n, Spain; email: rruiz@ugr.es",,Spanish Research Council,2100614,,,,Spanish,Rev.

Besides introducing each step of ECO, we report on how it was implemented to create Onto.PT, a public lexical ontology for Portuguese.

An extended technology acceptance model (TAM) is developed to test citizen engagement towards online e-government services from a sample of 307 citizens who used the benefits advisor tool within a Spanish City Hall. Although the proposed model follows TAM and explains the intention towards the actual use of e-government by postulating four direct determinants, ""A, PU, PEOU and BI"" have been considered as parallel processes, meaning that each can have separate influence in different levels of citizen engagement. To achieve this goal, a multinomial logistic regression is developed and tested to confirm the explanatory power of the four technology enablers on the four different levels of e-government. Our findings further suggest that in order to implement e-government, some of the enablers matter more than others to move from one level of citizen engagement to another. The main contribution of the paper is to question the use of existing models which seek to represent the relationship between technology enablers and the adoption of e-government services without considering their impacts on citizens' engagement.

Even advanced learners make collocation mistakes in that they literally translate collocation elements from their native tongue, create new words as collocation elements, choose a wrong subcategorization for one of the elements, etc. Therefore, automatic collocation error detection and correction is increasingly in demand. However, while state-of-the-art models predict, with a reasonable accuracy, whether a given co-occurrence is a valid collocation or not, only few of them manage to suggest appropriate corrections with an acceptable hit rate. Most often, a ranked list of correction options is offered from which the learner has then to choose. This is clearly unsatisfactory. Our proposal focuses on this critical part of the problem in the context of the acquisition of Spanish as second language. For collocation error detection, we use a frequency-based technique. To improve on collocation error correction, we discuss three different metrics with respect to their capability to select the most appropriate correction of miscollocations found in our learner corpus. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",CALL; Collocation; Collocation error; Collocation error correction; Collocation error detection; Miscollocation,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN: FFI2008-06479-C02-01/02, FFI2011-30219-CO2-01/02",partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under the contract numbers FFI2008-06479-C02-01/02 and FFI2011-30219-CO2-01/02.,,,,,,,,,,"Wanner, L.; Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Catalan Institute for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, Spain; email: leo.wanner@upf.edu",,Kluwer Academic Publishers,1574020X,,,,English,Lang.

There is a clear need for simplified texts, but manual production and adaptation of existing text is labour-intensive and costly. Automatic simplification is a field which attracts growing attention in Natural Language Processing, but, to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing simplification tools for Spanish. We present a corpus study which aims to identify the operations a text simplification system needs to carry out in order to produce an output similar to what human editors produce when they simplify news texts.

However, few studies have analysed the correlations between these constructs. From this evidence, the main goal of the present study is to examine the correlation between the perceptions of organizational culture and the perception of IC measures. A sample consisting of 401 workers from the technological, health and services sector responded to the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument and the Intellectual Capital Scale. Results show that the Competing Values Framework dimensions (clan, adhocracy, hierarchy and market cultures) are correlated with the three IC dimensions studied (customer, structural and human capital). Our results also show that the culture explained variance varies across organizational sectors. The current study provides an initial contribution to the investigation of the correlation between perceived organizational culture and IC measures. The discussion and analysis ends with an integrated framework with practical implications for management, followed by suggestions and guidelines for future studies. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Research institutes are seen as Decision Making Units (DMUs), which produce two different kinds of scientific outputs using inputs. We consider some outputs more important from a scientific point of view than others, which we refer to as bad. Financial constraints, recently imposed by the government, do not allow the institutes to freely dispose of their output portfolio, and bad outputs have to be produced in order to obtain external funds. Using the DODF framework it is possible to estimate the effect of fund cuts in terms of potential scientific products lost. By applying the Malmquist-Luenberger indexes we produce evidence on the trend of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) after the 2003 internal restructuring process. A comparison of results within the standard efficiency framework is provided and the big differences that emerge allow us to draw alternative conclusions on the recent evidence. © 2013 The Author.",directional distance function; malmquist-luenberger productivity indexes; scientific production function,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Falavigna, G.; CNR-Ceris, via Real Collegio 30, 10024 Moncalieri, Turin, Italy; email: g.falavigna@ceris.cnr.it",,,9582029,,,,English,Res.

University systems are in the midst of profound transformation and institutions are under growing competitive pressure to improve their performance. This tendency to introduce market mechanisms in education and extend more professional management systems to universities has translated into the appearance on the scene, unprecedented in some countries, of private universities, many as for-profit organizations. This article aims to assess the impact of private universities' activity on academic research. To this end, it conducts a case study of the Spanish university system, comprising 78 universities, 49 public and 29 private. Most of the latter were founded in the 1990s or later in response to a policy geared to enhancing performance in higher education by heightening competition. The conclusion drawn is that private universities, particularly the for-profit kind, conduct research less intensively than public institutions. Their contribution to this, the public good dimension of the university mission, is consequently still scant, for their focus is on teaching. © 2013 The Author.",research performance; Spain; universities,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sanz-Casado, E.; Department of Library and Information Science, , Madrid, Spain; email: elias@bib.uc3m.es",,,9582029,,,,English,Res.

The objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of these alternative web mention indicators in the Spanish academic system, taking into account their complexity (multi-domains) and diversity (different official languages). Design/methodology/approach - Inlinks, title and URL mentions from 76 Spanish universities were manually extracted from the main search engines (Google, Google Scholar, Yahoo!, Bing and Exalead). Several statistical methods, such as correlation, difference tests and regression models, were used. Findings - Web mentions, despite some limitations, can be used as substitutes for inlinks in the Spanish academic system, although these indicators are more likely to be influenced by the environment (language, web domain policy, etc.) than inlinks. Research limitations/implications - Title mentions provide unstable results caused by the multiple name variants which an institution can present (such as acronyms and other language versions). URL mentions are more stable, but they may present atypical points due to some shortcomings, the effect of which is that URL mentions do not have the same meaning as inlinks. Practical implications - Web mentions should be used with caution and after a cleaning-up process. Moreover, these counts do not necessarily signify connectivity, so their use in global web analysis should be limited. Originality/value - Web mentions have previously been used in some specific academic systems (US, UK and China), but this study analyses, in depth and for the first time, an entire non-English speaking European country (Spain), with complex academic web behaviour, which helps to better explain previous web mention results.

It also summarizes evidence from previous surveys. All available information indicates that only a few Spanish firms holding patents license them out. Results from the OEPM/OECD survey also reveal that obtaining public support is the first financial use of patents for Spanish firms. Responses to the same OECD questionnaire by EPO patent applicants from several European countries are quite different: licensing out is an extended practice among EPO patent holders from different countries, including Spain, and convincing venture capitalists and private investors are their two most important financial uses of patents. In our view this suggests that there are significant differences across European countries as regards the development of national technology markets and results from international surveys are driven by responses from the largest and more developed countries. The drivers and actors in markets for patents that only protect inventions nationally may be quite distinct from those in markets for patents that protect inventions regionally, such as EPO patents within Europe. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",EPO; Licensing; OECD; OEPM; Patents; Spain; Survey,,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: CSO2009-10845, CSO2012-32844","We are grateful to Pluvia Zuniga for her comments and support during the implementation of the OEPM/OECD survey.

I show how space can be localized and mobilized at the same time, and how space is conceived as situated and generative by different technologies which share a bottom-up approach that creates new forms of experience of the urban, resignifying its everyday codes. For this reason, I adopt an analytical framework that, drawing on actor-network theory and non-representational theory, underlines the performative aspects of both space and information and helps redefine concepts such as location and software in a processual and performative way. Comparing the actions of GS and AOS brings to the fore the importance of horizontal social practices and sociotechnical associations without which cities could not be intelligent nor could technologies be smart. Through their artistic interventions, urban space is recontextualized and activated by means of multi-authorial performances in which ordinary codes acquire shared meanings that allow for collaborative and open source practices. © First Monday, 1995-2013.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Timeto, F.; Università di Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, Italy; email: ftimeto@gmail.com",,,13960466,,,,English,First Monday,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890161560

Data collection was based on a questionnaire sent to the vice-rectors for research ofall Spanish universities. This information was supplemented by consulting directories of repositories, Spanish scientific journals, and institutional OA policies. The application of OA policies varies greatly. Spanish universities can be classified into five groups according to th number and quality of the actions taken. The first includes 7 universities (9% of the total) that have a comprehensive OA policy. The second includes 12 universities (16%) with a clear policy. The third includes 17 universities (23%) with an ongoing policy. The fourth includes 17 universities (23%) that have taken one or two actions and therefore have an incipient policy.

Results point out that groups with more members show higher absolute values of production, visibility and impact as a consequence of their bigger size. Regarding relative indicators, we conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between group size and the share of first quartile publications, as well as with the normalised citation impact. These results are determined by the Social Sciences area, where also per capita output is positively affected by group size.

The results reveal a dual behaviour for these authors depending on the national or international destination of their articles. Publishing in an international journal is usually done by authors from younger universities and implies multiple authorship, collaboration with foreign scholars and a high number of references to international journals.

While Spain was not initially a leading pioneer of museological research, the renovation airs of New Museology gradually found their way among museologists and scholars concerned with museums. As a result, an interest in museum pedagogy and museological didactics has developed, in an attempt to stimulate the exhibitions programmed in museums and bring their content closer to the public. This has triggered an awareness of the importance of regarding the museum as a space of communication and dialogue whose existing reality can be questioned, leading to the adoption of the hermeneutic and epistemological concepts furnished by critical Museology. While indebted to the Francophone and Anglo-Saxon museological traditions, Spanish Museology has sought its own path, and is attempting to confront the challenges presented by the 21st century with creativity and imagination, striving to open new spaces for reflection, dialogue and permeability to the demands of the postmodern museum. © 2013 Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

Because exposure to televised food marketing is a contributor to childhood obesity, it is important to examine the nutritional quality of foods advertised on Spanish-language children's programming. The authors analyzed a sample of 158 Spanish-language children's television programs for its advertising content and compared them with an equivalent sample of English-language advertising. The authors evaluated nutritional quality of each advertised product using a food rating system from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, the authors assessed compliance with industry self-regulatory pledges. The authors found that amount of food advertising on Spanish-language channels (M = 2.2 ads/hour) was lower than on English-language programs, but the nutritional quality of food products on Spanish-language channels was substantially poorer than on English channels. Industry self-regulation was less effective on Spanish-language channels. The study provides clear evidence of significant disparities. Food advertising targeted at Spanish-speaking children is more likely to promote nutritionally poor food products than advertising on English-language channels. Industry self-regulation is less effective on Spanish-language television channels. Given the disproportionately high rate of childhood obesity among Latinos, the study's findings hold important implications for public health policy. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,advertizing; child; childhood obesity; comparative study; epidemiology; ethnology; food; health disparity; Hispanic; human; language; nutritional value; statistics and numerical data; television; United States; advertizing; article; statistics; United States; Advertising as Topic; Child; Food; Health Status Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Language; Nutritive Value; Pediatric Obesity; Television; United States; Advertising as Topic; Child; Food; Health Status Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Language; Nutritive Value; Pediatric Obesity; Television; United States,"Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, RWJF","This research was supported by a grant to the first two authors from the Healthy Eating Research Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Integral to the research was an examination of structural barriers and inter-organizational relationships that act to facilitate the take-up, or otherwise, of technology. Theory regarding the diffusion of innovations and social network analysis provided the background. The qualitative method chosen for the study was constructivist grounded theory. The sample was purposively selected and data collection included semi-structured interviews with key actors; the mapping of organizational relationships; and the examination of websites. The findings indicate that organizations with a combination of good internal skills, and strong access to external advice and skills are in the best position to create websites that satisfy their needs, with good access to external information and communication technology services and advice more important than strong internal skills. Organizations must also consider how to deal with six broad areas related to the development and maintenance of websites: strategy; technical knowledge and design; project management; support; training; and funding.

It analyzes the number of documents and citations and how they vary by number of authors. They are also analyzed (according to author set cardinality) under different circumstances, that is, when documents are written in different types of collaboration, when documents are published in different document types, when documents are published in different computer science subdisciplines, and, finally, when documents are published by journals with different impact factor quartiles. To investigate the above relationships, this paper analyzes the publications listed in the Web of Science and produced by active Spanish university professors between 2000 and 2009, working in the computer science field. Analyzing all documents, we show that the highest percentage of documents are published by three authors, whereas single-authored documents account for the lowest percentage. By number of citations, there is no positive association between the author cardinality and citation impact. Statistical tests show that documents written by two authors receive more citations per document and year than documents published by more authors. In contrast, results do not show statistically significant differences between documents published by two authors and one author. The research findings suggest that international collaboration results on average in publications with higher citation rates than national and institutional collaborations. We also find differences regarding citation rates between journals and conferences, across different computer science subdisciplines and journal quartiles as expected. Finally, our impression is that the collaborative level (number of authors per document) will increase in the coming years, and documents published by three or four authors will be the trend in computer science literature. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Academic staff; Collaboration patterns; Computer science; Number of authors; Number of citations; Number of documents; Spain,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN: TIN2008-04528-E, TIN2010-20900-C04-04","Acknowledgments Work partially supported by Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, TIN2008-04528-E, TIN2010-20900-C04-04, Cajal Blue Brain and Consolider Ingenio 2010-CSD2007-00018 grants.",,,,,,,,,,"Ibáñez, A.; Computational Intelligence Group, Campus de Montegancedo s/n, Boadilla del Monte, 28660 Madrid, Spain; email: aibanez@fi.upm.es",,Kluwer Academic Publishers,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876090155

Selective links constitute a variant of external links where both the source and target of the link can be selected. This paper intends to study the influence of social platforms (measured through the number of selective external links) on academic environments, in order to ascertain both the percentage that they constitute and whether some of them can be used as substitutes of total external links. For this purpose, 141 URLs belonging to 76 Spanish universities were compiled in 2010 (before Yahoo! stopped their link services), and the number of links from 13 selected social platforms to these universities were calculated. Results confirm a good correlation between total external links and links that come from social platforms, with the exception of some applications (such as Digg and Technorati). For those universities with a higher number of total external links, the high correlation is only maintained on Delicious and Wikipedia, which can be utilized as substitutes of total external links in the context analyzed. Notwithstanding, the global percentage of links from social platforms constitute only a small fraction of total links, although a positive trend is detected, especially in services such as Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",External links; Sharing resource systems; Social platforms; Spain; Universities; Webometrics,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Orduña-Malea, E.; Department of Audiovisual Communication, Camino de Vera s/n, Valencia, 46022, Spain; email: enorma@upv.es",,Kluwer Academic Publishers,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876080889

Yet, despite the accomplishments of famous sports icons like Joe DiMaggio, or the perennial portrayal of the Mafia in popular culture, one chapter of this narrative continues to be noticeably absent; that is the decade-long appreciation that many in this community had for Italian fascism in the 1930s. The end result was that many poor immigrants gave up their wedding bands and other golden jewelry to support Mussolini's war in Ethiopia. In Providence, there was even a street named after Mussolini, which was quickly renamed after Italy declared war on the United States. Once hostilities began, this chapter of the Italian American narrative was either disowned or dropped altogether. Notwithstanding, the reasons for subduing this part of the Italian American story (along with how the community initially became attracted to fascism) are not considered ""just a simple matter.""

This adapted assessment tool rated the ""global success"" of the search and included criteria such as appropriate question formulation, number of PICO terms translated into search terms, use of Boolean logic, use of subject headings, use of filters, use of limits, and the percentage of citations retrieved that matched a gold standard set of citations found in a prior search by two librarians (who were not involved in assisting the subjects) together with an expert clinician. Main Results - The intervention group scored a median average of 73.6 points out of a possible 100, compared with the control group which scored 50.4. The difference of 23.2 points in favour of the librarian assisted group was a statistically significant result (p value = 0.013) with a 95% confidence interval of between 4.8 and 33.2. Conclusion - This study presents credible evidence that assistance provided by an experienced biomedical librarian improves the quality of the bibliographic database searches performed by residents and interns using real-life clinical scenarios. © 2013 Stone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Stone, M.; Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Bradford, United Kingdom; email: mathew.stone@bthft.nhs.uk",,University of Alberta,1715720X,,,,English,Evid.

Design/methodology/approach - The research develops an analysis of corporate identity in Spanish banking institutions, focusing on the communication of identity elements through corporate websites. A content analysis methodology is employed. Findings - A total of 230 categories related to six dimensions of corporate identity were identified: visual identity, communication, culture, behaviour, strategy and structure. The results show the elements most widely used by financial institutions and the moderating role of different dimensions (market scope, specialisation, etc.). Research limitations/implications - A natural sequel of this work would involve the analysis of other sources of identity communication, and measurement of the corporate image transmitted to stakeholders. Practical implications - The results obtained will allow entities to compare themselves to others in the same sector; likewise companies that are involved in mergers will be able to gain an understanding of the best way to build a new identity. Originality/value - Most literature on corporate identity is theoretical, with no empirical basis. This paper reveals empirically the elements of identity with a focus on banking institutions, and allows differences between entities to be established. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Banking sector; Brand; Content analysis; Corporate identity; Web sites,Banking institutions; Banking sectors; Brand; Content analysis; Corporate identity; Corporate websites; Design/methodology/approach; Financial institution; Key elements; Communication; Websites,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bravo, R.; Business Administration Department, , Zaragoza, Spain",,,14684527,,OIRNA,,English,Online Info.

These Noun Phrases can be understood as verbal paraphrases and, just like them, they can also denote argument and thematic-role relations. This paper presents the methodology followed to annotate the argument structure of deverbal nominalizations in the Spanish AnCora-Es corpus. We focus on the automated annotation process that is mostly based on the semantic information specified in a verbal lexicon but also on the syntactic and semantic information annotated in the corpus. The heuristic rules that make use of this information rely on linguistic assumptions that are also evaluated as we evaluate the reliability of the automated process. The automated annotation was manually checked in order to ensure the accuracy of the final resource. We demonstrate its feasibility (77% F-measure) and show that it facilitates corpus annotation, which is always a time-consuming and costly process. The result is the enrichment of the AnCora-Es corpus with the argument structure and thematic roles of deverbal nominalizations. It is the first Spanish corpus with this kind of information that is freely available. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Argument structure; Heuristic rules; Nominalization; Semantic corpus annotation,,"Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, MECD; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN: AP2007-01028","Acknowledgments We are grateful to Horacio Rodríguez and David Bridgewater for their helpful advice.

But a university has multidimensional prestige in a field of study only if it is influential with respect to a number of dimensions. The multidimensional prestige of influential fields at a given university takes into account that several prestige indicators should be used for a distinct analysis of the influence of a university in a particular field of study. After having identified the multidimensionally influential fields of study at a university their prestige scores can be aggregated to produce a summary measure of the multidimensional prestige of influential fields at this university, which satisfies numerous properties.

While useful for policy makers, such rankings also furnish information on an institution's ""prestige"", which may in turn contribute to more effective resource capture (students, funding, projects). Certain university profiles and missions may prevent many universities from climbing to higher positions, however. One important question in this regard is: how many of a country's universities can stand at the top of international rankings? The present article attempts to answer this question on the grounds of a study of the Spanish higher education system, and more specifically of an institutional alliance consisting of four high quality universities. A series of research activity indicators drawn from the IUNE Observatory are used to compare this alliance to leading Spanish and international universities and explore whether their visibility and consequently their position in international rankings would be enhanced if they were able to appear under a joint identity. This prospective study also addresses a series of strategies that the Spanish higher education system might implement to successfully rise to the challenges posed by future scenarios. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",IUNE observatory; Spanish universities; University rankings,,"Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte, MECD","Acknowledgments This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education’s Study and Analysis Programme under the project ‘‘Desarrollo de un observatorio de la actividad investigadora de las univer-sidades en el período 2002–2009, a partir de variables e indicadores de I ?

To make this overview more comprehensive we will focus on the three functions that Law can exercise over Information: hide, preserve and share. All topics discussed are highly related and the discussion of one has to take into account the other. The good news is that Law has been responding to the needs of the society due to the challenges posed by technological and social changes for millenia and it has the tools to do it again.

We used the contingent valuation method based on a willingness to pay scenario to estimate the value that each user is willing to pay. Data were collected through an e-survey sent to all Portuguese academic users. The main aims of this study are: (1) to investigate whether the willingness to pay is influenced by a set of factors (the frequency of use, whether the user previously knew b-on or not, the type of the user, the scientific area of the user, and the institution of the user); and (2) to estimate the demand function of b-on services as function of the price and the previously mentioned factors. In order to achieve these objectives we use several regression analysis techniques - OLS, Tobit model, linear probability model (LPM), Logit and Probit models. The results show that the factors studied are all important explanatory variables of the willingness to pay for b-on and important determinants of demand for b-on services.

In this context, the goal of this study was to test two potential groupings, universities belonging to the same Autonomous Community and campuses of international excellence (CEIs), to determine the ARWU placement that would result. To compute the ARWU indicators of these possible groupings, we used the methodology developed in Docampo (2012b). The results of our analysis clearly show the difficulty of improving ranking positions by calculating the sum of aggregated institutions. As a matter of fact, the only way to place a university cluster from Spain in the top 100 would be to treat all of the Catalan universities as a single institution.

Currently, mediation is set up as the previous phase of a binding and institutional arbitration system (the Consumer Arbitration Scheme) that is already in place in Spain. However, the White Book on Mediation in Catalonia shows that consumer mediation services are more widespread than consumer arbitration services. It also shows that mediation services have a high percentage of success, and companies prefer consensual, non-binding mechanisms. Today, consumer mediation has sufficient practical and conceptual independence from arbitration and therefore it is recommended that a consumer mediation scheme should be fostered. Thus, this article analyses what principles should guide such a regime, specifically in the online environment. The Consumer Code in Catalonia sets up some principles of consumer mediation. This article analyses the principles of impartiality, confidentiality, of voluntary participation and universality. Moreover, it explores whether other principles recognised at the European level may be taken into account, such as the principles of transparency, fairness and effectiveness. Furthermore, this article discusses interoperability and information security.

However, it is unclear how these effects vary across institutional characteristics or whether these effects persist when considering other factors that affects demand outcomes. On the other hand, student demand studies have almost always focused on the demand side of the equilibrium but not the supply side, although both demand and supply equations relate quantity to price. Although the supply is clearly a driver of demand, there are other variables that significantly influence the demand rates. Spanish public university system shows particular features not considered in the mentioned studies. This paper has two objectives. The first one is to modelize the demand for Masters Programs in the Spanish public university system. We propose a panel methodology to estimate the behavior of the demand of Masters Programs based on the data provided by the seventeen Spanish Autonomous Communities. Disaggregated analysis are presented for domestic demand and international demand. We conclude that the offer is a powerful attractor of demand for domestic and international students, and therefore actions of supply reduction should be carefully applied and always according to strategic university policy criteria. The second aim of the article is to analyze the Masters Programs in the Spanish public university system and to provide a benchmark of the current situation of supply (number of programs) and demand (enrollment) at regional level (Spanish Autonomous Communities) and in relation to European scenarios. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Benchmark; Demand models; Higher education; Masters programs; Panel data,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Benito, M.; Statistics Department, C/Madrid 126, Getafe 28903, Spain; email: monica.benito@uc3m.es",,,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857917246

This paper focuses on determining whether the cumulative advantage is present within a sample of 174 Spanish scientists doing research in four major areas (i.e.: physics, chemistry, biology and biochemistry). In order to determine the impact of their careers in research, we specify a multi-equational model. Among other variables, we include those related with their doctoral training, the postdoctoral period and the quality of the departments where scientists are hired after they finish their post doctoral work. Moreover, the model includes a group of hypotheses gathered from a survey of the literature on this topic. The model is based on the Path Analysis technique. We also have developed a method to determine the quality of academic departments using a single scale suitable for any country and discipline. The main result confirms the existence of cumulative advantage being the predoctoral productivity the main determinant of productivity during the ten years after obtaining the doctor degree.

The main features of this process have been a linear growth of productivity in terms of the number of papers published per year; a progressive growth -with a dramatic increase in the 2000's- of internationally coauthored papers, with a notable focus on European countries, although the United States remains Spain's main collaborator country; and the hegemony of the English language for scientific publications.",Authorship; Coauthorship; International collaboration; Science citation index; Science policy; Scientific publications; Spain,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alcaide, G.G.; Universitat de València, , Valencia, Spain; email: gregorio.gonzalez@uv.es",,,2100614,,,,Spanish,Rev.

Some projects implemented in these areas, particularly those which target the family as an audience, but which in some cases are also intended for day care centres and nurseries, create an increased awareness of the role of the library in the dissemination of children's books, as well as creating dynamic reading habits at an early age. This strengthens family ties and promotes healthier and more balanced child development. Taking family and school as two important contexts for the development of the readers, the library becomes a privileged space and vehicle to promote good reading practices from a very young age, and where books can act as the backdrop for interaction between young children, their families and care givers. © IFLA 2012.",children's libraries; libraries for infants; Portugal; pre-readers; public libraries,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ramos, A.

Few if any studies have investigated the factors that might contribute to the establishment of trusting relationship between city councils and citizens. This paper examines the relative importance and significance of three types of information communication technologies (ICTs) towards the use of e-government and the development of civic engagement. We conduct an empirical investigation of 179 Spanish official town websites (web sites in the municipalities). The research findings suggest that implementing ICT not only involves a step towards an increase in the use of e-government services by people, but also provides numerous opportunities for their civic engagement. The main conclusion of this study is that although ICT can leverage the adoption of e-government, it cannot create alone engagement with traditional activities of the local government. What is missing from this relationship is a mediating variable (adoption of e-government by government officers), which in turn can greatly help to better understand how ICT impacts relationships between governments and their citizens. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This is particularly true for IT sourcing decisions that go beyond cost considerations and are constrained by traditions, geographical location, and social networks. This article investigates how a company can disentangle itself from the constraints of the institutional environment. We do so drawing on a longitudinal case study of an Italian SME active in the steel industry that successfully changed its institutionally sound, but increasingly inefficient, IT sourcing practice. Our main result suggests that by attending steadily to institutional logics, organizations can become selective in how the institutional environment influences them and act more purposefully in their decisions. In particular, through the creation of companywide IT management competencies and targeted hiring practices, organizations can strike a balance between the different institutional logics guiding IT sourcing decisions and eventually shift from the dominant logic of localism to a logic of market efficiency. This change does not depend from a choice but rather builds on a process through which IT management competences are slowly integrated in the organization. © 2012 Operational Research Society Ltd.

The study considers the responses of the coordinators for these digital collections using a set of analytic criteria set out in the study. The handling of authorities in the group of university repositories studied may be described as uneven. Greater interest may be observed in controlling author entries, with laxer solutions for authority control of subjects. It suggests the need to establish effective poli-cies for the management of authorities by means of cooperative efforts permitting the building up of corpora of entries for authorities that would aid the processes of cataloguing, metadata creation, and information retrieval in systems based on syntactic and semantic interoperability in which manual intervention should be minimal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Almuzara, L.B.; Library of the Faculty of Humanities, Campus de Vegazana s/n, 24071 León, Spain; email: buffl@unileon.es",,,9437444,,,,English,Knowl.

All over the world the super intensive oliviculture method is based, essentially, on cultivars 'Arbequina' and 'Arbosana'. The benefit of this new training system mainly depends on the availability of cultivars characterised by compact trees, early bearing and low vigour. Since the Italian germplasm of olive is characterised by many well-known cultivars such as 'Frantoio' and 'Leccino', and it does not include 'Arbequina' and 'Arbosana', a trial to evaluate the adaptability of four Italian cultivars to the super intensive olive training system and to mechanical harvesting by an over-row modified grape harvester was set up in Umbria region, in central Italy, a place characterized by cold winter and short dry summer, assuming as reference the 'Arbequina' cultivar. The parameters determined were: tree characteristics (tree height, crown width, trunk diameter), bearing earliness, yield per tree, harvester efficiency and fruit losses, olive characteristics during ripening and at harvesting time. 'Arbequina' showed the most precocious reproductive stage, followed by 'Maurino', on the contrary the latest bearing was 'Frantoio' with only 18% of productive trees at the second growing season. In 2009 'Maurino' and 'Leccino' achieved the highest yield (around 3 kg of olive/tree), followed by 'Arbequina' (2.3 kg of olive/tree), and 'Frantoio' and 'Moraiolo' the lowest with 1.7 and 1.3 kg of olive/tree respectively. The harvester efficiency was very good all over. At the third growing season 'Arbequina', 'Moraiolo' and 'Maurino' resulted to be less vigorous than 'Leccino' and 'Frantoio'. Up to now, among the four Italian cultivars, 'Maurino' seemed to be suitable for super intensive oliviculture in terms of vegetative growth and reproductive aptitude.",'Frantoio'; 'Leccino'; 'Maurino'; 'Moraiolo'; High-density; Oil quality; Ripening,Vitaceae,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tombesi, A.; Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie e Ambientali, Borgo XX Giugno 74, 06121 Perugia, Italy; email: agostinotombesi@gmail.com",,International Society for Horticultural Science,5677572,9.78907E+12,,,English,Acta Hortic.,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863615258

Owing to this, the antioxidant activity of some populations of Lavandula latifolia (LL), Salvia lavandulifolia (SL) and Thymus mastichina (TM) have been evaluated. Samples of 10 populations of TM and 12 of each SL and LL have been collected at flowering stage during the summer of 2009 around Castilla y León (Spain). Dry plant material and dry residues after hydrodistillation were used for analysis. Total phenol content and antioxidant activity were determined. Two methods have been used to determine the antioxidant activity: 1) free-radical scavenging (DPPH), and 2) reducing power assay. The results showed that TM had the higher content in essential oil, although there was high variability among the populations in the three species. Total phenol content and antioxidant activity of dry plant material were higher in TM. In the case of hydrodistilled dry material, there were no differences between TM and SL, both species had higher phenol content and antioxidant activity than LL. Although there was variability among the populations and selection would be possible, TM is postulated as the most interesting species from an antioxidant activity point of view.",DPPH; Reducing power assay; Spanish sage; Spike lavender; Total phenol content,Lavandula; Lavandula latifolia; Salvia; Salvia hispanica; Salvia lavandulifolia; Thymus mastichina,,,,,,,,,,,,"Asensio-S.-Manzanera, M.C.; Unidad de Cultivos Leñosos y Hortícolas, Ctra. de Burgos km 119, 47071 Valladolid, Spain",,International Society for Horticultural Science,5677572,9.78907E+12,,,English,Acta Hortic.,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863614599

One of the most important transformations occurred in scholarly communication through the acceleration in the unbounded disclosure of scientific information (open access). However, the adoption of new channels varies according to the scientific areas. This study is part of an ongoing research that aims to understand the impact of digital media in the mechanisms of production and dissemination of scientific knowledge within a specific scientific community: historians. This paper will look at whether and how the history journals in Portugal are adopting electronic publishing and providing open access to their contents. To operationalise the study, thirteen R&D Units were contacted and asked to provide a list of the journals published and the format used. Furthermore, the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), Latindex and European Reference Index for the Humanities (ERIH) were researched. Finally, the websites of Portuguese higher education institutions with History Departments were consulted, with the aim of identifying any periodicals that might not have been previously identified. At the end, twenty-two titles were considered. Data seems to show that universities and History R&D Units increasingly value the free electronic access to research results produced by historians. © 2011-IOS Press and the authors.

The shift from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 involves social and technological developments affecting several professions, with implications for library users' expectations and, consequently, for the possible futures of libraries. Therefore, it is crucial that the staff of these organizations are aware of such concepts and associated resources, including blogs, RSS feeds, wikis, social networks, multimedia files, social bookmarking, instant messaging applications, document sharing networks and personalization functionalities on search interfaces. This paper reports the results of a study aimed at ascertaining the use of Web 2.0 tools by academic libraries in Portuguese public universities, as well as the transformation of libraries' online presence through these tools during a three-year period. Data was gathered through visits to websites in 2008, 2009 and 2010, and a numerical scale with seven levels was designed to evaluate the implementation of Web 2.0 tools in academic libraries. Although most libraries (58.7%) from a total of 75 organizations used none of the tools in 2008, there was a significant change by 2010. In 2010, no library remained at level 0; 36.0% were at level 1; 8.0% were at level 2; 26.7% were at level 3; 28.0% were at level 4; and 1.3% were at level 5. However, the highest level of the scale was never attained. The most prevalent Web 2.0 resource was found to be content syndication through RSS feeds, and wikis were the least used. The results suggest that Web 2.0 tools are used mainly to disseminate information and rarely to collaborate. Future perspectives and suggestions for librarians are presented.

Little attention, however, has been paid to how the news media employ online engagement tools to pursue political goals, as is the case when political parallelism is present. This study addresses this issue through an in-depth analysis of two Italian cases: the e-petition campaigns by the newspaper la Repubblica and the assemblage of a convergent media network to broadcast a protest rally organized by the television talk show host Michele Santoro. Online citizen engagement now constitutes a valuable political resource for journalists and news organizations that have historically been involved in the political battlefield rather than practicing objectivity and neutrality. However, these efforts are limited in their democratic potential to the extent that they constitute top-down leveraging of audience support by media elites rather than grassroots channels for citizens to set the agenda and voice their opinions.

We estimate the value of the Portuguese electronic scientific information consortium b-on by using two alternative evaluation methodologies: a) the value of the time saved by using this electronic resource; and b) the contingent valuation method to estimate how much the user is willing to pay for the service. Our results show wide differences in use patterns, with professors, researchers and PhD students having a more intense use of digital library services than undergraduate and masters students. Moreover, the benefit-cost ratios computed using the two valuation techniques indicate that the value of the electronic scientific information consortium b-on is well above its costs. Finally, the study shows that the valuation of b-on is higher for the user groups with higher percentage use of digital services. © The Author(s) 2011.",academic libraries; contingent valuation; electronic resources; impact evaluation; performance assessment; Portugal,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Melo, L.

Design/methodology/approach - First a content analysis of the Spanish universities' websites is carried out. To do this a disclosure index is created and applied. This index is more complex than those in previous papers, focusing on several issues, such as financial information, corporate governance, social responsibility, research, teaching activities, strategic information, timeliness, contact information, technology, interactivity with users, navigability and web structure. Then an empirical model is estimated by applying a linear regression, taking several factors into consideration. Findings - Three of the independent variables proposed to test the hypotheses - complexity, internationality and profitability - were statistically significant. Moreover, our findings emphasise prioritising use of the internet as a way to disclose teaching and research activities, as well as to monitor university bodies. Originality/value - The most valuable output from this paper has to do with the content of the information disclosed online by Spanish universities and with the analysis of the factors that explain the disclosure of information through Spanish universities' websites. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Explanatory factors; Information disclosure; Internet; Spain; Universities; Webpages,Explanatory factors; Information disclosure; Spain; Universities; Web page; Internet; Profitability; Teaching; Telecommunication networks; User interfaces; Websites; Societies and institutions,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gallego-Álvarez, I.; Faculty of Economy and Business, , Salamanca, Spain; email: igallego@usal.es",,,14684527,,OIRNA,,English,Online Info.

Design/methodology/approach - The web sites of public hospitals were searched for and analysed in 2005 and 2008. Their contents and features were scored using an 86-item checklist. Several hypotheses were proposed regarding the influence of internal and external factors on web site adoption and level of development. Logit and linear regressions were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings - Half of the Spanish public hospitals do not have a web site. The hospital web sites were acceptable in the information dimension but should improve their interactive features, as well as their navigation and usability. No significant improvements were observed during the period analysed. The size of the hospitals was a determining factor for web site adoption and level of development in both years. However, from 2005 to 2008, external factors - in particular internet penetration - became a significant factor to explain the adoption and level of development of web sites. Practical implications - Citizens are increasingly relying on the internet to search for health-related information. Hospital managers should exploit the advantages of implementing and properly developing a web site in order to improve the patient-care provider relationships and offer citizens reliable information about healthcare. Originality/value - To date, no empirical study has analysed the factors that influence the implementation of hospital web sites or the evolution of their contents and quality over time.

The evaluation involved 20 disciplinary areas, 102 research structures, 18,500 research products and 6661 peer reviewers (1465 from abroad); it had a direct cost of 3.55 millions Euros and a time length spanning over 18 months. The introduction of ratings based on ex post quality of output and not on ex ante respect for parameters and compliance is an important leap forward of the national research evaluation system toward meritocracy. From the bibliometric perspective, the national assessment offered the unprecedented opportunity to perform a large-scale comparison of peer review and bibliometric indicators for an important share of the Italian research production. The present investigation takes full advantage of this opportunity to test whether peer review judgements and (article and journal) bibliometric indicators are independent variables and, in the negative case, to measure the sign and strength of the association. Outcomes allow us to advocate the use of bibliometric evaluation, suitably integrated with expert review, for the forthcoming national assessment exercises, with the goal of shifting from the assessment of research excellence to the evaluation of average research performance without significant increase of expenses. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Bibliometrics; Peer review; Research assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Franceschet, M.; Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Via delle Scienze 206, 33100 Udine, Italy; email: massimo.franceschet@uniud.it",,,17511577,,,,English,J.

However, the relation between research performance and degree of internationalization at the level of single researchers still presents unresolved questions. The present work, through a bibliometric analysis of the entire Italian university population working in the hard sciences over the period 2001-2005, seeks to answer some of these questions. The results show that the researchers with top performance with respect to their national colleagues are also those who collaborate more abroad, but that the reverse is not always true. Also, interesting differences emerge at the sectorial level. Finally, the effect of the nation involved in the international partnership plays a role that should not be ignored. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Bibliometrics; International research collaboration; Italy; Research performance; Top scientist,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abramo, G.; Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Impresa, Via del Politecnico 1, 00133 Rome, Italy; email: abramo@disp.uniroma2.it",,,17511577,,,,English,J.

The library, considered a key factor in this transformation, also needs to make a transition to a new model, called a Learning and Research Resources Centre (LRRC), responding to the new educational needs based in the Bologna reforms. This paper aims to analyze the strategic plans of Spanish universities and to establish whether they consider the library a key element for change and, therefore, a priority. Also, we study whether the emerging library conforms to a traditional model or aims to become a LRRC as proposed and fostered by the Spanish university libraries' network, REBIUN. The analysis is mostly based on the 74 Spanish universities' strategic plans. Each one of them was thoroughly analyzed, creating relevant groups, based on what information they deal with. Libraries, judging by their thin presence in strategic plans, do not exist as agents of change in most Spanish universities. This is an indication that, even nowadays, they do not have the necessary institutional support to become an information system that is basic and necessary in the Bologna reform.

In this article we present findings from a qualitative study conducted with Spanish-speaking individuals with low-literacy designed to refine the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Informed Consent and Authorization Toolkit for Minimal Risk Research. Findings from this study indicate that familiarity with providing informed consent and authorization for research or the experience of being a research participant appear to play key roles in an individual's ability to understand the consent and authorization process. While the text of the consent and authorization documents can be simplified using plain language principles, comprehension of several fundamental ideas such as risk and privacy need to be safeguarded with a consent process that confirms comprehension. Recommendations are provided to address the informational needs of individuals with low literacy levels and limited or no experience with research participation.

These indicators, which consider the number of both documents and links, respectively, during a specific interval of time are intended to be applied in the design and construction of university rankings based on cybermetric techniques. The results confirm that the size differences among academic web domains vary significantly depending on the search engine used; therefore the use of a single web browser cannot supply reliable information about the actual size of the web domain. Moreover, the use of combined values from the mean obtained from each search engine does not offer reliable results, given the variance of data obtained from the different earch engines, as well as the index differences of Rs. The differences concerning visibility were smaller, but significant nonetheless. Rs and Rv indicators were found to provide useful and consistent information about the level of development of universities on the Web during a given time interval.

This technique has made it possible to identify the key issues in the strategic management of the most excellent large Spanish firms and also to describe trends in this sense. The methodology used consisted in a content analysis of the web pages of the Ibex35 companies of the Spanish Stock Market. Rather than focusing on the breakdown of businesses developed by each corporation, it was thought more appropriate to assess their respective corporate principles, as this would allow a better identification of the underlying managerial, organisational and strategic realities of these organisations.

The main hypothesis is that only an appropriate combination of the introduction of foreign technology and the creation of domestic technology guarantees the acquisition of the technological knowledge required for developing and less developed countries to reach a level closer to that of more developed countries. An evolutionary perspective has been applied considering that industrial growth depends on three types of variables: innovation or technology creation, dissemination potential and absorption capacity potential. The results confirm that the introduction of imported technology has been significant, both for unincorporated knowledge, shown in the growth of patents in the period 1960-1966, and that introduced through the importation of production technology by companies in the process of modernization. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Through this we identify 21 components composed of 28 subnets that reveal the micro-structure of a network of scientific collaboration. The network showed collaboration that was centralized in a few components. This collaboration originated in the research sector and included information retrieval and information management. This paper highlights the limited cooperation between subnets in which institutional and geographical proximity play an important role and which have scientific production and evaluation as common fronts of collaboration.

This has been no impediment to the simultaneous issuing of warnings regarding the dangers of their indiscriminate use when making comparisons. This is because the biases incorporated in the elaboration of these impact factors produce significant distortions, which may invalidate the results obtained. Notable among such biases are those generated by the differences in the propensity to cite of the different areas, journals and/or authors, by variations in the period of materialisation of the impact and by the varying presence of knowledge areas in the sample of reviews contained in the JCR. While the traditional evaluation method consists of standardisation by subject categories, recent studies have criticised this approach and offered new possibilities for making inter-area comparisons. In view of such developments, the present study proposes a novel approach to the measurement of scientific activity, in an attempt to lessen the aforementioned biases. This approach consists of combining the employment of a new impact factor, calculated for each journal, with the grouping of the institutions under evaluation into homogeneous groups. An empirical application is undertaken to evaluate the scientific production of Spanish public universities in the year 2000. This application considers both the articles published in the multidisciplinary databases of the Web of Science (WoS) and the data concerning the journals contained in the Sciences and Social Sciences Editions of the Journal Citation Report (JCR).

This platform makes available all the information regarding the articles published in the year 2000, via the well-known Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI) and the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). The fact that it does not include a JCR for Arts and Humanities prevented the employment of the Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). During the data collection process all the ‘‘articles’’ published in the year 2000 were recovered and the search was performed university by university. The following items were selected: authors, article, journal, ISSN and addresses. Two databases were created for each university, one for Sciences and another for Social Sciences.","As a result, the classification which in our judgement best responds to the objectives of the present study is that which focuses on knowledge branches or areas. This concept has led to diverse groupings, both in Spain and its surrounding countries. There exists in Spain the traditional classification into five macro-areas (Experimental, Sciences, Technology, Social Sciences and Humanities), employed by the Ministry of Education and Science (MEC) and the Conference of Vice-Chancellors of Spanish Universities (CRUE). An additional classification into eleven areas is employed by the National Commission for the Evaluation of Research Activity (CNEAI) to evaluate research on a 6-yearly basis.4 Internationally, the classification which separates knowledge into three macro-areas (Science, Social Science and Arts & Humanities) is more widely known.",,,,,,,,,"Gómez-Sancho, J.

Scholars all over the world are interested in Italian OPACs due to the treasures and the historical documents owned by Italian libraries. Design/methodology/approach: After a brief introduction on union and virtual catalogues, with special attention to the Italian scenario, Italian OPACs are illustrated with a rich amount of data about their usage, their geographical distribution, and their growth. All data are available on the web and have been collected in the time through the analysis of log files and the database of the Italian OPACs. Findings: The evolution of Italian OPACs suggests new developments of MAI, such as extension of search to some contents of digital libraries. These are studied and, as far as allowed by the available human resources, progressively adopted in order to improve the quality of the metasearch. Research limitations/implications: As this tool has no exact parallels in other countries, this paper mainly adopts a descriptive and heuristic approach, rather than evaluating MAI in comparison with other services. Originality/value: Although a wide amount of literature on MAI is available, only a few papers are in English. This paper then aims to increase the knowledge of MAI for a broadest group of non-Italian readers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Italy; Libraries; Online catalogues; Online databases,,,,,,,,,,,,,"de Robbio, A.; Law Libraries, , Padova, Italy; email: antonella.derobbio@unipd.it",,,1435124,,,,English,Libr.

At the beginning, the aim of this activity is twofold: on the one hand, fulfilling the principle of publicity of the norms, as it constitutes a basis for the efficiency of those, and, on the other hand, fulfilling a general function of information about the activities of public authorities. As the action of government generalises, this function of communication between those governing and those governed has extended to other fields of activity, thus, free and pay materials, both printed and electronic, are published. With regard to the traditional concept of official publications, the Internet has produced a radical change: today, the Web is the first information channel of the governments and public institutions. Therefore, it is urgent to decide how is the Internet to exercise these functions and ""to think"" what role we give to traditional official publications and to the new information systems. Moreover, the Internet makes transparency of public sector management easier, and makes governments become the major producers of information in their area of influence, from the smallest municipality to the most complex State. This article shows the results of a piece of research aimed at approaching the Spanish reality by means of the analysis of official publications edited in Spain between 2002 and 2005. The authors put the results in line with the recommendations of UNESCO to favour the fact that official information produced by electronic means might be a factor for the transparency of public authorities and the promotion of democratic ideals (equality, democracy and free access), not to mention other positive factors of an economic nature. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Only 24 % of libraries were found to have created such materials, focusing on explaining the sources of information and library services. Only three produced materials addressing information literacy. In general, these instructional materials were of poor quality from an educational point of view (few educational objectives, few exercises to reinforce learning, few pre-tests, and little final assessment) and commonly were little interactive (50 % involved slides and 20 % pdfs).

Making use of experience with IraLIS (International Registry for Authors: Library and Information Science = Links to Identify Scientists; http://www.iralis.org), this study examines how authorities are registered in two Spanish OAI-PMH-compliant projects: Recercat and E-Prints Complutense. The authorities database of the two repositories analysed were downloaded. The style of signing - the recommended one should contain only two elements - was recorded by field of knowledge, using the topic classification systems of the Intute project and the ANEP agency. The most commonly used signing style involved two surnames (76 % in Recercat and 94 % in E-Prints Complutense). The social sciences showed the greatest adoption of the recommended signing style (20 % of all records in this area). The adoption rate of the recommended signing style in both repositories was low, especially in E-Prints Complutense. The index of the use of the recommended signing style by knowledge field reveals a true picture of these Open Access repositories. This information could allow awareness campaigns to be designed for different fields of knowledge. It might be thought that the most internationalised sciences and the authors of its literature would take signing style into account, but this does not seem to be the case. Indeed, the social sciences were those which most frequently followed the recommended system. The areas of technology, health and life sciences, the arts and humanities should be the subjects of awareness campaigns. Further work should study the possible differences in the use of signing style depending on who inputs information into databases.",Authorship control; E-prints complutense; Open access repositories; Recercat; Recommended signature style; Standardization,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Orduña-Malea, E.; Facultad de Informática, Spain; email: enorma@upv.es",,,2100614,,,,Spanish,Rev.

The procedure for obtaining a granted patent from the EPO is composed of a series of sequential and selective steps imposing additional costs to the applicants. Accordingly, we argue that early withdrawals - i.e. those occurring before the proper examination process begins - should be treated separately from late withdrawals. Our findings show the probability of an early withdrawal is higher for applicants with lower resources and competencies and rises with the number of backward citations added by EPO examiners to the original application. Late withdrawals, instead, are negatively affected by one factor only: the size of patent family, which approximates the sunk costs born by applicants in order to extend the geographical scope of patent protection. Such a limited explanation suggests that the interventions of EPO examiners are likely to play a significant role in inducing late withdrawals. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The intervention group had a small decline in Hemoglobin A1c (-0.3%), and LDL cholesterol (-9.9 mg/dl), two important clinical indicators, while the control group had a small increase in both Hemoglobin A1c (+0.1%) and LDL cholesterol (+0.5 mg/dl). The discussion also explores the benefits and challenges of introducing computer-based patient education resources into a low-literacy population. © 2009 IOS Press and the authors.",Community Health Center; Computer; Diabetes; HbA1c; Health literacy; LDL cholesterol; Patient education; Spanish,Community Health Center; Diabetes; HbA1c; Health literacy; LDL cholesterol; Patient education; Spanish; Cholesterol; Computer control systems; Education; Glucose; Health; Hemoglobin; Sugar (sucrose); Surveys; Patient treatment,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zyskind, A.; Unity Health Care, Inc., 3020 14th St. NW, Washington, DC 20009, United States; email: azyskind@unityhealthcare.org",,,1675265,,ISUSD,,English,Inf Serv Use,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69549118631

While some recognition has been paid to the careers of prominent printers, little attention has been given to Spanish punchcutters in this period.The careers of individuals such as Eudald Pradell, Jerónimo A. Gil, Antonio Espinosa de los Monteros, as well as those of the Carmelite Friars Pablo de la Madre de Dios and Joaquín de la Soledad deserve greater recognition because of their importance to the development of Spanish printing.This article seeks to address this oversight, beginning with Pradell's contribution to the development of printing in Barcelona, going on to discuss the important work undertaken by Gil and Espinosa within the Royal Library Type Foundry. Of particular importance throughout this period was the development of Spanish typography and its relationship to the native calligraphic tradition. While it is generally agreed that Spanish typography was on the decline at the beginning of the nineteenth century, exceptional punchcutting work continued under the auspices of the Carmelite Convent of San José de Barcelona. Despite its chequered history, the tradition continues to inform the work of a number of prominent contemporary Spanish typographers. © 2009 The Bibliographical Society (typography) and the contributors (content).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Corbeto, A., Barcelona; email: bones-lletres@sct.ictnet.es",,,242160,,,,English,Library,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349673395

The impact of these quantified factors on patenting was examined from 1987 to the present. The institutional framework of bodies such as the CSIC was found to favour a patenting culture. The historical approach adopted defined homogeneous analytical periods and guided the interpretation of the results and their effects over time, while the economic approach allowed some of the relationships seen to be quantified and questioned the validity of merely descriptive classifications (e.g., scientific areas according to number of patents).",CSIC; Interdisciplinary approach; Patent; Public Research Organisation,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Azagra Caro, J.M.; INGENIO (CSIC-UPV) y JRC IPTS (Comisión Europea), Sevilla, Spain; email: joaquin-maria.azagra-caro@ec.europa.eu",,,2100614,,,,Spanish,Rev.

Design/methodology/approach - Exploration of the library web sites was undertaken in order to gauge the level of presence of packages that distribute electronic books. In evaluating the extent of content available, the data recorded were compared with those derived from another research carried out in 2004. Similarly, an approximate indication of the topic areas with greatest representation was attempted, distinguishing multi-disciplinary suppliers from those specializing in one field. Findings - Out of the 50 existing universities 36 support the subscription of at least one collection of electronic books. The universities of the communities of Andalusia, Catalonia and Valencia are those that have reached a greater implementation of e-books. There is a considerable diversity - many universities have subscribed to collections specializing in literature and in the field of engineering. The main multi-disciplinary collections purchased by libraries are E-libro and NetLibrary. Practical implications - This is a sector that is definitely taking off in Spain and will require progressive acceptance on the part of the academic community. Librarians have the responsibility to aid their users in understanding the growing complexity of the information market and the increasing range of resources available for research. Originality/value - The research is a necessary approach to the integration of collections of e-books into Spanish public universities.

The aim of this work was to determine the adequacy of these ranking systems as bibliometric tools for describing the output in Spanish journals of a university. The results show the University of Navarra published 7281 documents during the studied period, 1908 (26 %) of which were articles in journals. Just over 39 % of the latter were published in Spanish scientific journals, and 12 % in Web of Science journals. The coverage of the ranking systems varies per faculty: the IN-RECJ best covered articles published by the Law faculty; IN-RECS best represented production from Communication and Economics faculties; and RESH best covered production from Humanities faculties. Some 43 % of the studied articles recorded by IN-RECS were published in the first quartile of journals covered by the index; this figure was 42 % with respect to RESH, and 12 % with respect to JCR.

The management of an alphabetical subject catalogue requires the creation and management by the librarian of a true lexicon, aimed at establishing an informative dialogue with the user of the catalogue.

Public library buildings are often central to these projects as attractive magnets for the larger public. In recent years, Italy too has committed itself to such initiatives. However, rather than building brand new establishments, the local authorities prefer to renovate and adapt historical buildings to library functions. While small and medium-sized cities are proactive in this process, big cities and metropolitan areas lag behind and, even when they succeed in approving a project, they have a lot of difficulty in carrying them out. In this essay, three examples of libraries recently opened to the public are described from the organisational point of view: the Sala Borsa Library in Bologna, the San Giovanni Library in Pesaro and the San Giorgio Library in Pistoia. The BEIC (Biblioteca Europea di Informazione e Cultura = European Library of Information and Culture) project will also be outlined. The essay intends to show that these libraries are consistent with international library trends regarding mission and organisation of services and collections; however, in Italy, administrative and political constraints often raise hard to overcome obstacles, particularly in big cities. © 2008 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Web links between organizational websites are used as a proxy. Indeed, extremist groups increasingly use and abuse the Internet for their propaganda and their recruitment, and also for their internal communication. The analysis includes both political parties and non-party organizations, even violent groups. In a macro-, micro-, and meso-analysis, the various specificities of the two national political sectors are demonstrated and linked to the offline reality. The Italian network appears to be very fragmented, highly diversified, and difficult to be coordinated ('policephalous network'), whereas the German network is denser and much more concentrated on a few central actors ('star structure'). These differences are mainly due to political opportunity structures in the two countries. Additionally, whereas the Italian network structure allows for the construction of a typology of sub-groups of organizations, the German communicative structure seems to be more erratic and less coordinated. The article also highlights the function of websites which are not related to any specific group. Indeed, these are of special importance for the far right as a political arena which is usually banned from the dominant societal discourses (if not even legally forbidden). Considering this, new modes of communication can be of greater use for extremist groups than for more traditional political actors.",Communication networks; Network analysis; Political violence; Radicalization; Right-wing extremism,,"University of Maryland, UMD; European University Institute, EUI","This paper builds on a broader research project on the radicalization of political activism, financed by the START Center of the University of Maryland and directed by Donatella della Porta at the European University Institute, Florence.

It is organized in several sections, on extreme right-wing groups, extreme left-wing groups, and groups of extremist immigrants. For 2006, the Verfassungsschutzbericht mentions no less than 1000 web sites maintained by the German extreme right, but this also includes sites by private individuals. This confirms that the internet is an important tool of communication for German extremist groups, as a means of organizing protests, events, and meetings but also for online discussion.

Launched by blogger Beppe Grillo, and promoted via a word-of-mouth mobilization on the Italian blogosphere, V-day brought close to one million Italians in the streets on a single day, but was mostly ignored by mainstream media. This article is divided into two parts. In the first part, we analyze the volume and content of online articles published by both bloggers and mainstream news sources from 14 June (the day V-day was announced) until 15 September 2007 (one week after it took place). We find that the success of V-day can be attributed to the coverage of bloggers and small-scale local news outlets only, suggesting a strong grassroots component in the organization of the rally. We also find a dissonant thematic relationship between content published by blogs and mainstream media: while the majority of blogs analyzed promote V-day, major mainstream media sources critique the methods of information production and dissemination employed by Grillo. Based on this finding, in the second part of the study, we explore the role of Grillo in the organization of the rally from a network analysis perspective. We study the interlinking structure of the V-day blogosphere network, to determine its structure, its levels of heterogeneity, and resilience. Our analysis contradicts the hypothesis that Grillo served as a top-down, broadcast-like source of information. Rather, we find that information about V-day was transferred across heterogeneous nodes in a moderately robust and resilient core network of blogs. We speculate that the organization of V-day represents the very first case, in Italian history, of a political demonstration developed and promoted primarily via the use of social media on the Web.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pepe, A; University of California, United States; email: apepe@ucla.edu",,First Monday,13960466,,,,English,First Monday,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950260815

In order to conceptualize knowledge assets, the paper adopts the intellectual capital (IC) framework, which distinguishes three IC components: human, structural and relational capital. As regards business strategy, the paper adopts Miles and Snow's model, which identifies three strategic types of successful organizations: Defenders, Analysers and Prospectors. The paper explores the ways in which the three strategic types differ in weighting the single components of their IC. This study represents an attempt to extend the Miles and Snow typology including the aspect of knowledge assets. The link between knowledge asset management and strategy is investigated by means of three case studies conducted in Italian small and medium enterprises from the food sector.

There is a longstanding fascination with the fact that some professors during the Renaissance had extremely high salaries. It has been suggested that at the top of the salary scale were the superstars, professors who could attract many students and raise the prestige of the university. Through an analysis of data on the salaries of professors at Padua in 1422-1423, I argue that much of the differences in salaries can be explained in terms of the stage of career of professors. Those professors who have taught the longest tend to be paid the most. Hence, there is little evidence for the superstar thesis. Copyright © 2009 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wray, K.

Such an indicator can be related to the state of knowledge of research groups and can show some interesting properties: 1) it must be related with the incorporation of information pieces in an informal way, say the rate of self-citations; 2) it must follow the natural tendency of the groups towards a progressively updated state of knowledge, and 3) more productive groups will tend to use more recent information. These natural hypotheses have been investigated using a medium sized Spanish institution devoted to Food Research as a case study. Scientific output comprised 439 papers published in SCI journals between 1999 and 2004 by 16 research teams. Their 14,617 references were analyzed. Variables studied were number of published papers by every team, number of authors per paper, number of references per paper, type of documents cited, self citation rate and chronological range of reference lists. Number of authors per paper ranged between 1 and 15. The most frequent value (N = 128) was 3 authors. Average number of authors per paper is 4.03 (SD = 1.74). Mean number of references per paper (including review papers) is 33.3 (SD= 17.39) with slight differences between the groups. Mean self-citation rate was 13.72 % (SD = 11.7). The greatest chronological range was 119 years; half of all ranges was 30 years and the general mean for this variable was 33.34 years (SD = 16.34). D values were associated with self-citation rate and a negative relationship between D and chronological range of references was also found. Nevertheless, correlation figures were too small to reach sound conclusions about the effect of these variables. Number of references per paper, number of contributing authors and number of papers published by each team were not associated with D. D values can discriminate between groups managing updated information and delayed research teams. Publication delay affects D figures. Discontinuity of research lines, heterogeneity of research fields and the short time lapse studied could have some influence on the results of the study. It is suggested that a great coverage is needed to evaluate properly D figures as indicators of information update of research groups. © 2008 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Amat, C.

Design/methodology/approach - The study took as its reference the existing literature on the examination of the quality of web sites and the importance of content as a key variable in determining web site quality. To quantify the corporate governance information disclosed by Spanish listed companies, three transparency indexes were designed. To contrast which variables determine the information provided online, the investigation based itself on studies about voluntary disclosure in companies, and three lineal regressions models and an ANOVA analysis were performed. Findings - The empirical evidence obtained reveals that the firms that score highest for transparency are also those that are most likely to use the internet as a channel for the disclosure of corporate governance information. The results show that disclosure levels depend on the degree to which firms are followed by analysts, their listing age, their ""visibility"" and the fact of belonging to the communications and information services industry. Practical implications - The need for this study was clear in view of the increasing interest shown by supervisory authorities for the oversight of the European and US capital markets in regulating not only the content but also the manner in which corporate governance information is disclosed over the internet. During the coming years, regulatory stock market agencies will have to strive to take advantage of the opportunities that the internet offers to increase both the relational and informational capacity of company web sites. Originality/value - Corporate governance research has focused mainly on the analysis of the information that firms ought to disclose and the effects of disclosure generally, without considering the media involved. This paper suggests a new approach that examines the relevance of technology, particularly the internet, and orients supervisory authorities in the direction to follow for improving corporate governance transparency in listed companies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Corporate governance; Disclosure; Internet; Spain,Industrial management; Information services; Optical properties; Transparency; World Wide Web; ANOVA analyses; Capital markets; Corporate governance; Corporate governances; Design/methodology/approach; Disclosure; Empirical evidences; Europeans; Key variables; Listed companies; New approaches; Practical implications; Spain; Spanishs; Stock markets; Supervisory authorities; Web sites; Internet,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gandía, J.

Design/methodology/approach - The study takes as its reference point the existing literature on the examination of the quality of web sites, in particular the provisions of the Web Quality Model (WQM) and the importance of content as a key variable in determining web site quality. In order to quantify the information on city council web sites, a Disclosure Index has been designed which takes into account the content, navigability and presentation of the web sites. In order to contrast which variables determine the information provided on the web sites, our investigation bases itself on the studies about voluntary disclosure in the public sector, and six lineal regressions models have been performed. Findings - The empirical evidence obtained reveals low disclosure levels among Spanish city council web sites. In spite of this, almost 50 per cent of the city councils have reached the ""approved"" level and of these, around a quarter obtained good marks. Our results show that disclosure levels depend on political competition, public media visibility and the access to technology and educational levels of the citizens. Practical implications - The strategy of communication on the internet by local Spanish authorities is limited in general to an ornamental web presence but one that does not respond efficiently to the requirements of the digital society. During the coming years, local Spanish politicians will have to strive to take advantage of the opportunities that the internet offers to increase both the relational and informational capacity of municipal web sites as well as the digital information transparency of their public management. Originality/value - The internet is a potent channel of communication that is modifying the way in which people access and relate to information and each other. The public sector is not unaware of these changes and is incorporating itself gradually into the new network society. This study systematises the analysis of local administration web sites, showing the lack of digital transparency, and orients politicians in the direction to follow in order to introduce improvements in their electronic relationships with the public.",Information strategy; Internet; Local authorities; Spain; Worldwide web,Communication channels (information theory); Education; Information dissemination; Internet; Information disclosure.; Information strategy; Web Quality Model (WQM); Websites,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gandía, J.L.; Faculty of Economics, , Valencia, Spain; email: juan.l.gandia@uv.es",,,14684527,,OIRNA,,English,Online Info.

Due to the growing number of professionals, associations and publications, archivistics techniques and principles generalisation, standardisation, new technologies, archivistics in the University, and University research on archivistics matters we can verify a considerable advance in theory. The result is a proliferation of archivistics handbooks, and of publications that show the development of specialised archivistics, the mechanisation of archivistic operations, and the concern about basic matters such as documental selection, studies on documental typologies, the diverse models of archival classification with an application of organic-functional criteria, an application of ISAD(G) to documental description, the legal problems of access to documents and the conservation of heritage, and the newest of the electronic documents. To sum up, there is a strong advance in archivistics theory and practice among archivistics professionals, although the existence of a specific academic degree is still pending. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bibliography archives; History of archives and archivistics; Spanish archives; Spanish archivistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,"López Gómez, P.; Department Humanidades, , Ferrol, La Coruna, Spain; email: plogo@telefonica.net",,,13890166,,,,English,Archival Sci.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43349086824

The main claim of most social scientists is to consider the Internet as a new resource for political engagement. However, this claim has not always been backed up by empirical analysis. The aim of this article is to provide empirical evidence on a subject that previous surveys on the Internet have generally ignored: the influence of individual political characteristics on Internet use. The authors compare data from two distinct surveys, carried out in two different periods but which contain some common batteries of questions referring to political participation and Internet use for political purposes. One survey was carried out in 2001 and focused on students at the University of Florence. The second was carried out in 2002 and focused on the participants in the European Social Forum in Florence. The empirical results and interpretations offered are based on a sample of 397 students, extracted from the two databases. The focus of the research is on exploring whether and how the political use of the Internet is shaped by the political characteristics of users, in this case students. The findings of the two studies suggest that, firstly, the more students are engaged in different social and political organizations, the more they use the Internet to achieve political purposes; and, secondly, that different styles of Internet use (to retrieve alternative information, to discuss and to perform political actions) are associated with the political characteristics of users. In particular, the characteristics of offline participation are reproduced online: the Internet is appropriated and shaped by political practices of users. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",Political orientation; Political participation; Political use of the Internet; Students; Survey; Young people,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Calenda, D.; Università di Firenze, Via delle Pandette 21, 50127 - Florence, Italy; email: davide.calenda@unifi.it",,,1369118X,,,,English,Inf.

To do so, the quality of these resources has been analysed in the light of data provided by a series of indicators grouped in seven criteria, most of which were used to determine what information is made available and in what way. The criteria used in our analysis are: visibility, authority, updatedness, accesibility, correctness and completeness, quality assessment and navigability. All in all, the results allow us to carry out an overall diagnosis of the situation and also provide us with information about the situation at each university, thus revealing their main strengths, namely authority and navegability, and also their chief shortcomings: updatedness, accessibility and quality assessment.

Seven main criteria were selected, taking into account the fact that the foremost aspect to be evaluated in this work was the dissemination of information about the EHEA; the other criteria were therefore dealt with to a lesser extent and analysed in less depth. a) Visibility of information. The purpose of this criterion is to determine the visibility of the website dedicated to the EHEA of each university, that is to say, to find out whether it is easily visible from the home page of the university website. This is a very significant criterion because, at the present time when we on the verge of implementing European convergence as far as higher education is concerned, it is important to have access to high quality information about this process and about the new model of education. Universities must facilitate access to this information, since they are involved in the process and the EHEA affects the whole university community, that is, both teaching staff and students, as well as all the other members of staff working at the university. Such valuable information must therefore be readily available and anyone wishing to search for it must be able to find it without any kind of difficulties.",,,,,,,,,,"Pinto, M.; University of Granada, Po de Cartuja, s/n, 18071, Granada, Spain; email: mpinto@ugr.es",,Springer Netherlands,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547313702

The results obtained show that there are factors which have a positive influence on these indicators, such as having a third-cycle programme, with public financing obtained in competitive selection procedures, having a large number of full-time researchers or involvement in collaborations with international institutions. However, other factors which appear to have the opposite effect were also noted. These include a higher number of students per lecturer or a lower proportion of lecturers with recognised six-year periods. © 2007 Akadémiai Kiadó.",,,"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN; Comisión Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnología, CICYT: SEJ2005-04348/ECON, SEJ2006-07665","Web of Science database (which is part of the ISI Web of Knowledge database, to which we have access by means of a subscription financed by the Ministry of Education and Science).","Authors wish to thank an anonymous referee for his/her helpful suggestions and comments.

Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth in patenting and licensing activities by PSROs. We argue that the whole process depends to a certain extent on scientists' willingness to disclose their inventions. Given this assumption, we conduct research into individual behaviour in order to understand scientists' views concerning the patenting of their research results. Data from a questionnaire survey of Portuguese researchers from nine PSROs in life sciences and biotechnology is presented and analysed and complemented with in-depth interviews. The results reveal that overall the scientists surveyed show a low propensity to become involved in patenting and licensing activities, despite the fact that the majority had no ""ethical"" objections to the disclosure of their inventions and the commercial exploitation of these. Perceptions about the impacts of these activities on certain fundamental aspects of knowledge production and dissemination are however divergent. This may account for the low participation levels. Furthermore, most scientists perceived the personal benefits deriving from this type of activity to be low. Similarly, the majority also believed that there are many difficulties associated with the patenting process and that they receive limited support from their organisations, which lack the proper competences and structures to assist with patenting and licensing. © Springer-Verlag/Akadémiai Kiadó 2007.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Moutinho, P.S.F.; Instituto Superior da Maia, Maia, Portugal; email: pmoutinho@ismai.pt",,Springer Netherlands,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846348575

The Treaty also placed in American possession the Spanish records kept in the various agencies of the former colonial administration of the islands. Upon assumption of its role as the new de facto colonial regime, the American insular government initiated the process of collecting the Spanish colonial records to be housed in a central repository that became the nucleus of the National Archives of the Philippines. An important aspect of understanding the context of archives in post-colonial Philippines is to trace its early beginnings and to examine the archives' association with former colonial powers. Established against the backdrop of the shift in the continuum of colonial regimes, the archive is undeniably a colonial creation and a manifestation of colonial domination. For the contemporary imagination, however, its very presence represents a common and collective past that consequently contributes to the formation of a ""national consciousness"" and ironically reinforces the idea of nationhood of the formerly colonized territory. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Archives and nationhood; Colonial archives; Spanish colonial records,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Punzalan, R.L.; School of Information, , Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2112, United States; email: ricpunz@umich.edu",,,13890166,,,,English,Archival Sci.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547821463

Users are still confronted by classic problems of information seeking: information overload, errors in subject searching, and the predominant use of the system's simpler options. The results show that the OPAC is broadly used by end-users not only for obtaining printed material, but also for connecting to the electronic resources subscribed to by the library.

This article explores a key interpretive outcome, accuracy , in 21 Spanish/English informed consent consultations. Discussions were transcribed, translated, and coded according to established techniques. Most (74%) discussion was accurately interpreted (range: 47%-98%; std. deviation: .137). Accuracy was lower in the more technical portions of the discussion when compared with nontechnical portions such as discussion of coping and quality-of-life issues ( p = .024). The concept of "" randomization"" often was poorly communicated and interpreted. These differences may be due in part to the use of long, uninterrupted, and jargon-filled sentences by clinicians explaining research, among other factors. The article concludes that accuracy may be promoted if clinicians used less technical language and shorter sentences, and are more ""process driven."" Interpreters may need to be better informed about research-related concepts such as randomization. Further research is needed to determine the effects of interpretive accuracy on the informed consent process, the decision to participate in research, and other outcomes.

Data were obtained from a survey of researchers ascribed to the 'Biology and Biomedicine' area of the Spanish Council for Scientific Research, as well as from their curricula vitae. One quarter of the scientists work as members of teams in the process of consolidation. Our findings illustrate the importance, for the development and consolidation of research teams, of the availability of a minimum number of researchers with a permanent position and of a minimum number of support staff and non-staff personnel (mainly post-doctoral fellows). Consolidation of research teams has a clear influence on the more academic-oriented quantitative indicators of the scientific activity of individuals. Researchers belonging to consolidated teams perform quantitatively better than their colleagues in terms of the number of articles published in journals covered in the Journal Citation Reports, but not in terms of the impact of these publications. Consolidation favours publication, but not patenting, and it also has a positive effect on the academic prestige of scientists and on their capacity to train new researchers. It does not significantly foster participation in funded R&D projects, nor does it influence the establishment of international collaborations. Impact is influenced to a remarkable degree by seniority and professional background, and is significantly greater for young scientists who have spent time abroad at prestigious research laboratories.

External conditions may dramatically affect the measurement of performance. We apply theDaraio&Simar's (2005) nonparametric methodology to robustlytake into account these factors and decompose the indicators of productivity accordingly. From a preliminary investigation on the Italian system of universities, we find that economies of scale and scope are not significant factors in explaining research and education productivity. We do not find any evidence of the trade-off research vs teaching. About the trade-off academic publications vs industry oriented research, it seems that, initially, collaboration with industry may improve productivity, but beyond a certain level the compliance with industry expectations may be too demanding and deteriorate the publication profile. Robust nonparametric methods in efficiency analysis are shown as useful tools for measuring and explaining the performance of a public research system of universities.

Design/methodology/approach - No national library statistics existed in Italy. In Italy there is no national law governing public library services and no national authority for them. The Official Publications Working Group of the Italian Library Association, in collaboration with the Central Institute for the Union Catalogue of Italian Libraries and the Italian National Statistics Institute (ISTAT), carried out a survey, financed by the University of Perugia, to collect information about the presence of official publications in Italian public libraries. A high percentage of answers was collected. The few questions, useful for the identification of the main peculiarities of the answering libraries, were able to supply for the first time some national data about Italian public libraries. Findings - The paper presents aims and objectives of the survey, methodology, the unexpected success. ISTAT methodological office stated that the responding libraries constituted a valid sample of Italian public libraries and the results of the survey could be considered the first Italian national library statistics. Results, limits, impact and some prospectives for the future are presented. Research limitations/implications - The first official national statistics about Italian public libraries are an unexpected success. Practical implications - It has proved however that we need wider agreements among institutions and funds, to have regular national library statistics. Originality/value - Thanks to this survey, for the first time we can speak about Italian public libraries in terms of numbers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Italy; Public libraries; Statistics; Surveys,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Boretti, E.; Biblioteca Sala Borsa, Bologna, Italy",,,14678047,,,,English,Perform.

Starting from the new legislation requirements, the purpose of this study is to investigate whether Italian Local Health Authorities websites are accessible to users with different abilities. METHODS: One hundred and seventy websites were analysed evaluating their compliance to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Priority 1 guidelines via a combination of appropriate accessibility testing methods. This review was carried out twice: the first time it took place between the end of 2003 and May-June 2004. The same survey was repeated again in December 2004, after the issuing of the draft of the Implementation Regulations for The Stanca Law in July 2004. In this second survey, all the websites analysed before were checked again to establish if some measures to make those sites accessible were taken. RESULTS: Seventy-six per cent of the analysed websites fail to satisfy the most basic W3C requirements, but Italian Local Health Authorities websites are likely to present significant improvements to access for some disabled user groups: the number of accessible websites increased consistently between the first and the second review. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that awareness of web accessibility issues is increasing among developers of health information websites because of law enforcement.

Our paper takes as its starting point the previous literature on information systems and tries to analyse if those reasons are related to the outsourcing level as well as to the different characteristics of the firm and its information systems department. With this aim, a survey was made among information systems managers in those firms. The results show that outsourcing gives the firms the possibility of enhancing their information systems services and departments. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The path of hiring of junior researchers along the history of the institution is reconstructed. We find that age structure has a depressing effect on productivity and derive policy implications.

The performance and the visibility of these journals were evaluated in terms of Impact Factor (IF), mean IF from citing journals and cited journals, and self-citing and self-cited rates. Seventy-three Italian journals were indexed in the JCR, 14 of which achieved an IF equal to or higher than one. Most citing journals were European and American, thus showing a fairly good visibility of the articles published in the 14 journals analyzed. The self-citing and self-cited rates showed a wide variation. The journal that appeared to perform best was the Journal of High Energy Physics, an electronic publication whose success seemingly confirms Internet circulation as an effective means to enhance the visibility and consequently the quality, in term of citations, of a journal. Italy's low overall expenditure on research & development (R&D) and low number of researchers compared to countries with longstanding high publishing standards and traditions are no doubt partly to blame for its poor performance in scientific publishing.

We analyse to what extent productivity of individual researchers is influenced by the level of consolidation of the team they belong to. Methodology is based on the combination of a mail survey carried out among a defined set of researchers, and a bibliometric study of their scientific output. Differences among researchers have been investigated with regard to team size and composition, patterns of publication in domestic and foreign journals, productivity, co-authorship of papers, and impact of publications. Results indicate that not belonging to a research team represents a handicap at the time of publishing in top international journals. Researchers belonging to consolidated teams are more productive than their colleagues in non-consolidated teams, and these in turn more than individuals without team. Team size does not appear to be as important for scientific productivity as the number of researchers within the team that reached a stable job position. Analysis of the impact factor of journals has not revealed differences among researchers with regard to the visibility of their papers.",,,"Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, CSIC","Bibliometric analysis was carried out starting from bibliographic information retrieved from the CD-ROM version of a multidisciplinary domestic database (ICYT), a multidisciplinary international database (SCI), and an international database specialised in Earth Sciences (GeoRef).

A preliminary study of Italian language monographs was done at a large research university library to discover the prevalence of these vendor records compared with records created by LC and OCLC member libraries. It was found that over the period 1996-2000 there has been a drastic decline in the number of original member records for Italian books and a corresponding increase in vendor records, which then must be upgraded by member libraries. The implications of this finding include changes in cataloging-department workflow and a decrease in national-level cooperative cataloging, depending on the extent to which libraries export unmodified vendor records and edit them in-house.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,American Library Association,242527,,,,English,Libr.

To this end, we have investigated the relationships between MR instruments, their scientific productivity or medical performance and several socio-economic, R&D or health care indicators in a Spanish and European context. The distribution of MR spectroscopy instruments among Spanish Autonomous Communities suggests that the allocation policy resulted from a compromise between the pull of demand based on regional strength in R&D activities and the push of convergence criteria to bring underdeveloped regions up to a national standard. On the whole, the average value for Spanish MR spectroscopy equipment (1.6 units per TRDP) was within the average value of 1.7 found in 6 European countries. The scientific productivity of these spectometres in Spain (10.3 publications per unit), compares with the ratio (12.4) found in the United Kingdom and was above the six countries' average (8.3). Larger differences in productivity were observed between Spanish Autonomous Communities, suggesting the existence of important laguna in the distributive side of the allocation policy. Consistent with its socio-sanitary importance, the regional distribution of MR imaging equipment in Spain correlated with the number of sanitary personnel and regional population or wealth. The average number of installed units per million inhabitants in Spain (3.3) is very close to the average found in five European countries and the diagnostic procedures per installed units are close to the 5 countries' average values of 3400/year. However, the scientific productivity of MR imaging equipment in Spain (1.6 publications per installed unit in the five year period) was very low as compared with other European countries (3.7 on average). Higher diagnostic demand or lower publication pressures could explain these differences equally well. Our results suggest that increases in scientific productivity and medical performance of MR instrumentation in Spanish Autonomous Communities may not necessarily involve a net increase in the number of MR instruments but rather, improvements in the global socio-economic throughputs derived from the organisation of R&D and medical service policies.",,,"CAM 08.1/0023/97, CAM 08.1/0046/98, MEC PB96-0864-C02","The present work was made possible by grant INF95-1315-E (Programa Nacional de Información para Investigación Científica y el Desarrollo Tecnológico) to A.P. and grants MEC PB96-0864-C02, CAM 08.1/0023/97 and CAM 08.1/0046/98 to S.C.

This study was conducted to assess whether the SMOG formula, originally developed and tested in English, was also valid for texts written in Spanish and French. Readability scores from a sample of passages written in Spanish, English, and French were analyzed. Study results showed that the SMOG formula seemed to be consistent in measuring readability in the three languages. However, SMOG scores varied from language to language. Two hypotheses are being laid out to explain these results. First, the SMOG equation is systematically biased for texts in Spanish or French. Second, English is more readable than French, and French is more readable than Spanish. Under the assumption of a systematic bias in the SMOG formula, the so-called SOL formulas are presented here to convert SMOG scores between Spanish, English, and French. In addition, a new scale for grading reading difficulty is proposed based on SMOG scores obtained from classical literature. This is important to the extent that it will provide Spanish speaking and French speaking health communicators with a readability formula for preparing written materials appropriate to the level of comprehension of specific target audiences.

The objectives of the study were to determine the degree to which standards are actually used, and to develop recommendations for improving standards and increasing familiarity with them among authors, editors and publishers. Journals were identified from five printed and four electronic bibliographic databases. Compliance was assessed with the evaluation checklists developed by López-Cózar and Ruiz, based on 136 elements derived from standards for the presentation of periodical publications developed by the International Standardization Organization (ISO), and from recommendations published by UNESCO, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, the Council of Biology Editors and E.J. Huth. For most parameters three aspects were evaluated: presence, presentation and location. Compliance with publication standards by Spanish biomedical journals was generally low (34.3%). This reflected the complete absence of specific elements relating to the volume (cover, contents list, index) and abstract sheet, rather than a general neglect of a large number of standards. In contrast, items related to characteristics that specifically distinguish periodical publications from other types of documents generally showed good compliance. The poor degree of compliance with standards by Spanish biomedical journals can be explained in part by the lack of familiarity with standards on the part of authors, editors and publishers, and in part by the fact that these three actors in the publication process are rarely involved in the creation and development of standards. To improve compliance, I propose changes in the policies on how standards are disseminated and how proposals for new standards or revisions of existing ones can be made, and suggest changes in some parts of ISO standards 8: 1977 and 215: 1986.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Delgado López-Cózar, E.; Depto. de Biblioteconomia y Docum., Campus de Cartuja s/n, E-18071 Granada, Spain; email: edelgado@goliat.ugr.es",,Aslib,220418,,,,English,J.

Whereas the first library automation systems were introduced in the UK, USA and Canada in the early 1970s, the first experiences in Spain dated from the following decade. Lack of institutional support for library modernization tended to be compensated for by the dedication and commitment of professionals across the library system, particularly in the Spanish university and research library sector. The principal problem pending is the modernization of the National Library, which has been in the slow process of reform over the past 20 years. Outlines the steps that should be taken in order to ensure true modernization of libraries in Spain: adopt a global perspective; integrate libraries in institutions; create more flexible library staff; introduce reinforced services; build stable relationships with users; improve communication; provide information that is needed and not that which the library holds; design a real global strategy; take full advantage of new technologies instead of following in the wake of developments; promote interlibrary co-operation by adopting common policies; and find a clear place in the market.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Moscoso, P.; Faculty of Information Science, C/ San Cirilo s/n, 28801 Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain; email: p.moscoso@alcala.es",,Cambridge Scientific Abstracts,9610006,,,,English,J.

These changes are evident in the economic, social, cultural and political aspects of our society. Governments, all over the world, are seeking the most appropriate responses to this situation, responses which will bring maximum advantage for their countries through the introduction of information strategies and policies to shape the development of information societies. In this context, the Information Society Project Office (ISPO), at the European Union, decided to compile an inventory of European Information Society projects and actions to support the decision-making process for Information Society initiatives. The initial development period was set at two years, starting in February 1997. This paper outlines some of the more important landmarks in the creation and development of an Information Society in Portugal. Analysis of the European Survey of Information Society (ESIS) questionnaire returns is limited to the Portuguese experience and does not attempt to cover the complete survey. These are early days in the development of ESIS; the aim of this paper is to promote awareness and to widen discussion concerning the identification of trends and possible candidates for progress indicators.",,Decision making; Economic and social effects; Internet; Public policy; Social aspects; Strategic planning; Information societies; Information technology,,,,,,,,,,,,"Correia, Ana Maria R.; Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal",,"Bowker-Saur, London",1655515,,JISCD,,English,J Inf Sci,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032641284

The Science Citation Index was used to measure integration, and the articles were classified for comparison into eight fields (clinical medicine, experimental medicine, geology, chemistry, physics, biology, pharmaceutical science and mathematics). The minimum criterion for integration was considered fulfilled when the size of the two communities of citing authors considered (Spanish and non-Spanish) was equal, i.e., when the absolute number of citations in both communities was equal. On the basis of this criterion, articles in clinical medicine and experimental medicine were found to be integrated into the international literature. The regression lines for the number of citations per year in each field in the two communities of citing authors were parallel, indicating that integration of Spanish publications in these two fields was stationary. Of the fields found not to be integrated, the lines for pharmaceutical science citations in the two communities indicated little sign of future change in the proportion of Spanish to non-Spanish citations. Citations in the remaining five fields indicated a steady decrease in integration. We introduce the concept of the ""drag effect"" of national citations on citation indices in the international literature: a sharp increase in the number of Spanish articles published in non-Spanish journals may exceed the capacity of the international community to ""absorb"", understand and cite these new publications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jiménez-Contreras, E.; Fac. de Biblioteconomia y Docum., , Granada 18071, Spain",,Springer Netherlands,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009729336

Since medical studies comprise both theoretical education and practical training, clinical (bio)chemistry must be taught by preceptors experienced in clinical laboratory operations. In Italy, where medical education traditionally has been separated into basic sciences and clinical sciences, clinical biochemistry has been added as a course to bridge between the two phases of the curriculum. However, the broader changes in Italian medical training will create a more cohesive pattern of teaching, and the integration of different material into a 'layer cake' curriculum. In such a structure, clinical (bio)chemistry will be considered a clinical discipline devoted mainly to teaching the use of laboratory tests, while the linkage between basic and clinical sciences falls to general pathology and pathophysiology. Nevertheless, to avoid overlap and lack of propaedeutical coordination, the content of the clinical (bio)chemistry-course must be coordinated with both the basic and the clinical sciences. This viewpoint is also supported by IFCC/IUPAC guidelines on teaching clinical chemistry to medical students. © 1994.",Clinical biochemistry; Clinical chemistry; Education; Laboratory medicine,"article; biochemistry; clinical chemistry; education program; italy; medical education; priority journal; Biochemistry; Chemistry, Clinical; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Italy",,,,,,,,,,,,"Burlina, A.; Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University of Padova, Via Giustiniani 2, 35128 Padova, Italy",,,98981,,CCATA,7720276,English,Clin.

A series of quantitative criteria are being applied to the submission of data on total scientific production, productivity rate, publications/authors ratio, coauthorship, type of documents edited and their distribution, all of them broken down per university. Last but not least, a review is made of the distribution by subjects of each publication. The results obtained underline the increasing rate of production achieved in the three-year period, a certain stagnation in the number of authors and in team research activities, a far too endogamic diffusion in periodical publications and a somewhat unbalanced thematic diversification as compared to the geographical and cultural variety of our country. The article concludes by suggesting new lines of study for determining the factors that may explain the existing patterns of scientific production, and for identifying useful bibliometric measures aiming at an assessment of this type of literature. © 1992 Akadémiai Kiadó.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rubio, A.V.; Instituto de Inf. y Documentación en CC.

All Italian manufacturing firms were screened in the analysis and, at the end of a screening process, 8,220 of them, which had introduced relevant technological innovations over the period 1981-1985, filled out either a mail questionnaire or were covered through a personal interview. Data and preliminary comments on the following problem-areas are set in the paper: type of innovation introduced in the firm (product, process), impact of innovations on the firm's products and sales, cost of innovation, technological relevance of innovations introduced, impact of innovations on the utilization of input factors, factors linked to the introduction of innovation, performance of R & D. Data show that technological innovation is a complex aspect of company life; it relates to both products and production processes: in more than half of the cases firms introduced both product and process innovations, whereas only products or processes were introduced in about 20 per cent of cases, respectively. It is also apparent that the majority of innovations are new only for the firm, and that only a limited share are new for the sector or for the country. Looking at the techno-scientific ""quality"" of the innovations introduced, quite often innovations were classified as technical improvements or enhancements, and in a very limited number of cases they were considered as applications of a scientific breakthrough. The breakdown of the innovation costs shows that, on average, more than half of the cost is attributed to investment (machinery, equipment, etc) one fourth to engineering and design activity, one fifth to R & D and the remaining 5 per cent to marketing activities. The most important factor linked to the introduction of innovation appears to be the acquisition of plant and machinery. This confirms the result of previous analyses which show that the introduction of new technologies hinges upon new machinery and equipment, often the sole means for the acquisition of technology produced by other economic agents - a diffusion and adaptation process is occurring. R & D was mentioned in a limited number of cases. In the paper a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the R & D performed by the firm is reported. In particular, it is shown that the number of R & D performing manufacturing firms is more than double that which emerges from the annual survey on research and development activities carried out by the Italian Central Statistical Office. © 1991 Akadéemiai Kiadó.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cesaratto, S.; Institute for Studies on Scientific Research and Documentation, Italy",,Kluwer Academic Publishers,1389130,,,,English,Scientometrics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-13044256683

In addition, a library assistant was hired to serve as a bibliographic searcher for the project. The library assistant is a native Spaniard, and is completing a Ph.D, dissertation from the University of Salamanca. Because the qualifications for the professional position required specialized language and subject expertise, there was a considerable delay in filling the position. Additional staff were added during the second fiscal year in order to raise productivity sufficiently to compensate for the initial delay; the project is now assured of completion by the end of the grant period. The first phase of the project was to identify those materials requiring original cataloging. Bibliographic searching has now progressed through more than one-half of the monographs and both original cataloging supported by grant funds and copy cataloging provided by the UCSD Library are being completed. A total of 2,700 monographic titles had been fully cataloged by June 30, 1983, and over 1400 new records had been added to the OCLC database. A complete breakdown of the types of cataloging processed through June 30, 1983 follows:","During the next one and a half years of the project, the remainder of the monographs in the collection will be fully cataloged. Cataloging of pamphlets and ephemera began recently and will be completed by the end of the grant period. Since these materials are even more rare than the monographs processed earlier, the overall percentage of unique materials in the collection may ultimately approach 50 percent. Serial cataloging will also begin within the next year and will proceed over the next few years supported by library funding. Full bibliographic records meeting national standards for cataloging (AACRZ), content designation (the MARC format), subject analysis (LCSH), and classification (LC classification schedules) will be made available for all items via OCLC, the National Union Catalog, and the University of California Online Union Catalog (Melvyl). In addition, microfilming of additional rare and brittle materials will be completed and acid-free storage containers will be supplied for all of the pamphlets in the collection.",,,,,,,,,,,,1462679,,,,English,Collect.
