Unfortunately, networks, such as Facebook, have been designed largely for younger users, leading to challenges for the elderly in the use of their interfaces. Some human-computer interaction (HCI) research has explored the usability and accessibility of Facebook and its functionalities, including for the elderly. However, there has not been a great deal of research exploring communicability of this social network Facebook for older users. This paper presents the results of a 2015 case study completed in Brazil, in which Facebook's accessibility and communicability for the elderly were analyzed. As a result of this research, checkpoints are presented to support designers in the construction of virtual spaces for social interaction. © 2019, Carolina Sacramento, Simone Bacellar Leal Ferreira, Eliane Pinheiro Capra, and Ana Cristina Bicharra Garcia.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059469718

Results revealed that dwellers have often appeared in their own media as new community leaders, or as journalists, and frequently, as conveyors of culture and personality. This paper shows that personalising the life in favelas is emphasised, through which producers tailor a more individualist, less-victimised image of themselves. © First Monday.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051413839

We analyzed and compared Network Links from tweets of two years, using Netlytic as a mining text tool. This research presents two contributions: 1) the links analysis perspective of social media; and, 2) we proposes a methodology to assess the impact of online social media and government promotion. Our findings suggest that citizens use social media platforms to interact with politicians in offices, and supports the argument about ""networked individualism"" in which analyzed Twitter accounts reveal many citizens' opinions and retweets related to the governor's use of YouTube for his State of the Union speech. Decision-makers can use this study to improve communication with their customers (public) and allocate resources effectively for better public services.

In order to achieve so, a case study with two units of analysis was conducted: one consisted of tests with five deaf people and the other was comprised of five normal hearing listeners with an educational profile and computer skills similar to the deaf group. The research was conducted in eight steps: (i) ethnographic study; (ii) participants profiling and selection; (iii) selection of health campaigns to be examined; (iv) tasks definition; (v) pre and post-testing interviews; (vi) testing; (vii) data analysis; and, (viii) recommendation list development.

This paper examines how value is created in GSNs by studying the collective behavior of content creators in a popular GSN, Foursquare. In particular, this study examines the multifaceted aspect of content contribution behavior, and investigates how it occurs in multiple cities of an area previously studied by few: 21 medium- and large-sized Brazilian cities. Our study leverages cluster analyses to explain how users differ in how they collaborate.

This pattern is also reflected in Internet governance-related diversity research to date.

A significant amount of information, both administrative and academic, has been published at the institutional Web site. This has happened without formal policy, and by individual initiatives of departments interested in distributing content of potential interest for the Peruvian academic community. There are some misgivings about the end results, the appropriation of the information outside of this University itself; this is consequence of specific cultural and social attitudes toward digital content and the way that the Internet has been socially shaped in Peru.

The functioning of a major archive will be described with reference to the British Library Sound Archive. Preserving large collections for the long term is a primary concern in the digital age. While digitization and digital preservation has many advantages over analogue methods, the rate of technology change and lack of standardization are a serious problem for the world's major audio archives. Another challenge is to make collections more easily and widely accessible via electronic networks.

Both institutions evolved in a similar manner, which suggests that common economic and social forces were at work. Perhaps the histories of these two industries may be helpful in understanding current and future developments in computer- and Internet-related media.

I will also look at how the Internet is being used to promote Cuba as an upmarket tourist destination, tourism now being Cuba's most valuable source of foreign currency and, therefore, critical to its ailing economy. Cuba's telecommunications infrastructure is poor and outdated which, when combined with the severe restrictions placed on the Cuban population, makes Internet access beyond the reach of most Cuban citizens. Cuban opposition groups, based mostly in the United States, do not face these barriers and, in the second part of this paper, I will examine how a number of these organisations are using the Internet to promote their anti-Government agendas and counter the state 'propaganda' machine.

Since then the emergence of a 'global village' has become a universally accepted idea. McLuhan is perhaps more to the point when he observes that ""The organic everywhere supplants the mechanical. Dialogue supersedes the lecture"" (McLuhan, 1964; pp. 255-256). This paper takes a cue from McLuhan and discusses the way different types of information flows reveal the underlying power structures related to the provision and exchange of information. In line with McLuhan it is argued that 'dialogue', or information exchange, through networked media will have to play a role of increasing importance in development, whereby dialogues will have 'horizontal' and 'vertical' dimensions. Networked media are in that way to facilitate rural networking and social change. In its essence information provision, or 'lecture' is claimed to strengthen existing power structures, to create dependencies and to lead to a mismatch between information demand and supply. Despite the fact that networked electronic media are favored for rural development, they obviously do not have the same reach and levels of access and accessability as the traditional electronic media do. Another distinction between media is the type of information and content they are able to convey in a message, whereby significant differences between traditional and networked electronic media can be distinguished. Based on the two above mentioned distinctions between electronic media combinations of electronic media are suggested for use in rural development, both to improve the quality of the information provided and to change existing information and communication related power structures.
