Employing a qualitative methodology, it centers on the ‘Goodbye Dublin: The War of Independence in the City’ commemorative exhibition, staged by Dublin City Pearse Street Library, between August 14th and October 31st, 2019. The findings show that the commemorative nature of the exhibition appealed to a variety of new, lapsed and frequent library users, connecting with Irish and non-Irish residents, as well as tourists visiting the city. In this regard, the exhibition was effective in its objective of appealing to a new and wide-ranging audience, however, the findings underline the need for more diverse and varied marketing, if this aim is to be entirely successful. The staging of the exhibition as an active authoring and articulation of the past by the library is highlighted, and the use of multimedia is seen to transform the library into an emotionally charged, dynamic, and multisensory space. This facilitates an immersive encounter, involving interplays between the exhibition narratives and visitors’ personal memories and interests. This offers different ways for visitors to engage with the library, inspiring them to find new meanings, explore issues of personal, collective and national identities, and to reassess contemporary events. Overall, the research makes an important contribution by highlighting the complexity and importance of commemorative exhibitions in the context of public libraries. © 2022 The Author(s).

Freedom of Information requests were made to all UK public library services. The data received indicated that almost 65% of UK library services saw a reduction in physical loans of between 70% and 90% of pre-pandemic borrowing levels. The cumulative data also revealed that almost 120 million books that were issued in pre-pandemic years were not issued in the 2020/21 lockdown period. Meanwhile, 47% of library services saw their e-loan provision rise between 100% and 200% on pre-pandemic levels, although these numbers rose from a low base and were comparatively small when measured against physical loan losses. The data also highlighted that active membership of the public library services (members who had borrowed an item in the previous year) dropped to 40% of pre-pandemic levels across the UK. The evidence highlights that while e-loan provision rose significantly while physical library services were largely unavailable, this rise was from a very low base, and this rise in digital usage did not come close to mitigating the drop in physical borrowing that occurred across the UK. The findings of the paper suggest that even when the public had no choice but to move to digital, they did so in limited numbers when compared to usage of physical library buildings and collections. © 2022 The Author(s).

Although there are numerous initiatives among public libraries for teens, there is limited literature about the provision of online services and assistance for teens during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study seeks to highlight the services, efforts, and initiatives of Qatar National Library, specifically its Young Adult (YA) Section, in planning and implementing virtual services to address the information needs of teens during a pandemic. Additionally, this study will present information that might help library professionals design their own library plans and programs to serve young adults virtually.

To do so, a theoretical model was designed and validated. To collect the data required for the study, a questionnaire was administered to a number of 212 librarians who were working in public libraries in Iran selected through stratified random sampling. For data analysis, the SMART PLS software was used. The results of the study showed that developing different types of trust in libraries through OI and OBSE increases KS. Moreover, among the factors under study, OBSE proved to have the greatest effect on the librarians’ KS. KS in libraries is supported by a variety of plans and initiatives. This study highlighted a number of organizational factors for developing the librarians’ KS. As such, library managers can make use of the librarians’ ongoing KS behavior as an efficient policy to outperform competitors. This paper contributes to the research on organizational knowledge management by elaborating on the relationship between trust and KS in staff. To the authors’ best knowledge, to date, no empirical study has been conducted on the role of trust in librarians’ KS with regard to the effect of OI and OBSE.

The five critical insights include: (i) there is not enough professional learning experiences (PLE) or learning culture in their library; (ii) PLE must be sought out personally and a major portion of PLE has to happen on their own time; (iii) PLE is primarily found online, and that utilizing social media is a crucial way to find PLE opportunities; and (iv) PLE opportunities are wanted.

Taking the form of a series of projects in a dozen countries meant to help catalyze library development around national goals, the program operated from 2011 to 2018. Starting from a point at which libraries in most low–and middle-income countries were neglected, disused and staffed by librarians with outdated skills, it effectively launched public libraries into national dialogue in some countries and failed to do so in others. This article explores the conditions and actions that led to effective projects and what lessons for future library development efforts might be gleaned from the program’s work. In Myanmar and Georgia, the program attracted new investment into public libraries aligned with central government digital strategies. In Bangladesh and the Philippines, the program integrated public libraries into education efforts where they had been previously ignored. With more than a quarter million public libraries in low–and middle-income countries, there remains vast potential for library systems to reinforce their relevancy in the 21st century, attract new resources, and provide vital services. Library leaders around the world can build on the experience of Beyond Access to help inform initiatives to revive libraries around modern needs. © 2021 The Author(s).

During the coronavirus disease pandemic, VVs have become increasingly common, but are not equitably accessible, which may exacerbate existing health disparities. Widening health disparities are of particular concern in the rural U.S. where broadband is lacking. Because public libraries are trusted sources of health information and typically offer free use of broadband internet to patrons, they can help bridge the digital health divide and assist patrons with VVs. However, no guidelines currently exist for care providers and libraries to implement this potentially complex undertaking. In this paper, we review concepts related to the digital health divide and its impact on telemedicine inequities, and propose a research framework for evaluating public libraries as potential hubs for residents living in broadband-poor communities to connect to a telemedicine VV. There is currently a paucity of research evaluating the use of libraries for telemedicine, although partnerships between libraries and health providers may be increasing. We use an established health implementation science framework to guide a research agenda to examine the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of collaborative programs between libraries and health providers intended to leverage public libraries to improve access to telemedicine VVs in broadband-poor communities. The use of public libraries as spaces from which patrons can participate in VVs with providers is promising, but research is urgently needed to guide implementation. © 2021 The Author(s).

In these present times of transformation, during which digitalization and the intensive use of technologies are modifying the way in which knowledge is produced, public libraries are facing new and disruptive challenges. The emergence of certain innovation ecosystems within libraries, which place the community at the center of cocreation and codesign processes between different agents, has transformed some public libraries into encountering spaces. The Library Living Lab, in the Miquel Batllori Public Library of Sant Cugat del Vallès (Barcelona, Spain), is an expression of this systemic change. The following paper is a case study based on that sociotechnical infrastructure and analyzes, through two singular examples, how digital technologies can be drivers of social transformation when citizen engagement is placed at the center of innovation processes. The case study also provides insights into how public libraries may become key agents in fostering and strengthening social cohesion through situated, collective, and technology-based innovation practices. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, despite the importance of indigenous knowledge in promoting the knowledge economy, it has been observed that many indigenous knowledge systems in developing countries such as Nigeria are gradually becoming extinct due to cultural, educational and economic developments. This paper investigated the preservation and use of indigenous knowledge in public libraries in Southwest Nigeria. A survey method anchored on the positivism paradigm was employed for the study. Based on this, copies of the questionnaire was used as a data collection instrument. One hundred and fifty (150) library personnel were randomly selected from the five (5) purposely chosen public libraries in Southwest Nigeria. The study’s findings revealed that educational purposes were the primary reason for using the indigenous knowledge in the libraries. It was also revealed that video and audio recordings were significant sources of preserving IK in public libraries. Access to IK resources by the users was through the use of ICT tools such as computers and compact discs, while inadequate funding was identified as the major challenge facing the development of IK. The study recommends, among others, increased budgetary allocation to public libraries for the management of IK resources; and that practical steps should be taken to create awareness on the need to preserve IK activities in video or audio formats. This study contributes to knowledge in IK development by providing new data and information relevant to policymaking and IK research. © 2021 The Author(s).

Libraries may contribute to these processes, provided they meet specific conditions. First of all, the librarians need to be outgoing, trusting and eager to help, to make contacts with users easier. A high level of individual social capital and an active and extensive social network (measured by the number of acquaintances) contribute to the development of social capital in library communities. The purpose of the analysis presented in this paper is to show the social activity of library personnel, focusing in particular on the number of acquaintances. A statistical analysis of survey feedback from librarians from 20 countries across the world was conducted in order to determine how extensive the social network of librarians working in different types of libraries and on different positions is and what independent variables influence that network. The number of acquaintances is another indicator, alongside the level of trust, of social capital. The study provided a better insight into the social relations mechanisms that take place in libraries. This is important, because library functions have been evolving in recent years, shifting their focus to social engagement and integration. © 2021 The Author(s).

Content analysis was performed on a dataset of 9,450 tweets published by 38 public libraries in New York City between December 2019 and April 2020. The study showed that 85.5% of the tweets published by NYC public libraries were related to regular library communications, such as announcements of library service updates, book recommendations, suggested readings and activities, celebrations of specific occasions or individuals, and notices of upcoming events. Meanwhile, 14.5% of the tweets published from January/April 2020 were directly and explicitly related to COVID-19. NYC public libraries posted details of the remote library services available during the closure, as well as comforting and socially supportive messages, and provided information about the financial, health, and food-related support available to the community. The findings suggest that during the pandemic, NYC public libraries mostly continued to conduct business as usual and, in doing so, may have brought a valuable feeling of normalcy to the communities they serve during those problematic and strained days. © 2020 The Author(s).

Public libraries are places of sanctuary and connection for people experiencing challenges such as homelessness, poverty, mental illness, domestic violence and substance abuses. In recognizing their role to serve the needs of all people who enter their buildings, public library staff are often asked to work outside their areas of expertise to meet the needs of community members. Public library staff can experience feeling overwhelmed and anxious when working with this community, often wanting to help but not knowing where the boundary between providing support and undermining the self-determination of the individual lies, and not knowing what resources and services would best meet the needs of these visitors. To assist patrons with high social needs and library staff, the City of Melbourne Libraries followed an approach now common in the United States of America, but largely untested in Australia by working with a local housing group to place a social worker in their City Library. This article explores the early work of the Library Social Worker as she engaged with library patrons and provided training to library staff. Using statistics and case notes that describe her activities and their outcomes, we can see that although this practice is new for the Australian public library system, the placement of a social worker into a busy urban library has significant benefits to both patrons in need and the staff who work with them. © 2020 The Author(s).

A “bricolage” approach was used to develop an evidence-based framework of value and subsequently to gather data about Californians’ use of and attitudes about public libraries. The framework was developed through an extended literature review and applied across data gathered through a survey of residents, interviews with library stakeholders, a review of statistics on library usage, and a review of the outcomes of grant-funded programs in California public libraries. The most significant outcome of our project is a unique value proposition for California’s public libraries. These libraries deliver value for individuals, families, groups, communities, and society as a whole. They provide opportunities and support for learning and knowledge development, health and wellbeing, community development, and economic development. Value is delivered through a unique combination of resources, people, and space. California’s public libraries are largely offering services that are valued by the public; however, public awareness of the range and nature of services offered remains lower than desired. Practitioners can use the evidence-based framework and the unique value proposition to better understand the aspects of their library services that offer most value to their communities, and to make more persuasive cases for library support. This paper is the first to use an evidence-based framework of value in assessing the impact of California’s public libraries. © 2020 The Author(s).

Yet, bureaucracy is not something that we talk too much about, within the discipline of librarianship, or as it relates specifically to public libraries. Hence, bureaucracy in public libraries represents an undertheorized space. This paper aims to spark conversation about bureaucracy in public libraries, including both positive and negative characteristics and effects. As literature specific to libraries as bureaucracies is in short supply, social science theory is imported to make sense of this dense and knotty topic. Specifically, Max Weber’s metaphor of the “iron cage,” George Ritzer’s idea of “McDonaldization,” and David Graeber’s take, in which water represents “the water in which we swim,” are applied to the context of bureaucracy in public libraries. As well, the new body of theory known as critical librarianship provides new perspectives and insights as to bureaucracy in libraries. This review of literature brings the bigger picture into relief, and offers some language with which to continue describing and addressing this otherwise misunderstood, overlooked issue of bureaucracy in public libraries. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Chelsea Jordan-Makely.","Bureaucracy; critical librarianship; David Graeber; George Ritzer; max weber; Mcdonaldization; public libraries",01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087070307

Public libraries in Harare are struggling to provide for the diverse and dynamic needs of users. This is evidenced by the high number of school-going users frequenting these places because of the limited number of well-resourced school libraries especially in marginalised communities. Public libraries are providing for the information needs of communities and schools in order to enhance inclusivity. It has become imperative for public librarians to rethink, reinvent, and re-profile their services to meet the growing, diverse, and dynamic needs of users. The article explores the extent to which public libraries can incorporate cultural responsive services for the benefit of users. It will examine how public libraries can rethink and reconfigure their services and space to accommodate inter-cultural and inter-generational dialogue. It will recommend strategies for balanced inclusivity in the accessibility of public library services. © 2020 The Author(s).

In their disaster responses, public librarians work to effectively restore library buildings, provide library materials, and, most critically, provide services that strengthen community resiliency and sense of safety. However, a neglected aspect of disaster policy and response is the lack of documentation regarding library transportation accessibility. In this study, the researchers used geographical information systems (GIS) approaches to investigate the extent to which public libraries are sited to serve vulnerable, rural populations in Northwest Florida. Results suggest that many public library branches are inopportunely sited relative to pockets of high-need populations, indicating that disaster services may need to be offered outside of the library building or transportation options be made available to residents of disaster-prone, inaccessible areas. The study’s findings have the potential to inform library and information studies education, multidisciplinary research and policy-making, and to develop a public library disaster preparedness and response. © 2020 The Author(s).

Then, to help public libraries create lifelong learning programs steeped in humanistic values, the authors identify components of humanistic lifelong learning and examine educational programs that practice these values. Finally, the authors integrate these programs into the “matrix of humanistic lifelong learning” that can help public libraries establish a system of lifelong learning that is humanistic, individualized, and can be tailored to the local community. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Paul Wilcox and Dale Monobe.","human capital; humanism; library programming; Lifelong learning; self-directed learning",01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084269277

Key to the existence of legislation is the assurance that information services and access are developed within the set regulatory framework. Since the existence of public libraries especially in South Africa is highly regulated, it becomes imperative for Library and Information Services (LIS) practitioners to be conversant with regulations governing the sector. This paper reports on a study that was undertaken to examine legislation and support mechanisms that promote equitable information access in South African public libraries. Internet access was part of the study as it forms the basis toward bridging the digital divide. The study was necessitated by the view that puts access to information as a right which is guaranteed by Chapter 2 of the Bill of Rights, enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (Act No. 108 of). As a result, public libraries serve as the platform on which information is disseminated and accessible to communities. The paper was guided by research questions on; the extent of public libraries development in South Africa; regulations impacting on public libraries and awareness of regulation governing internet access to public libraries. The study employed a survey design in which a questionnaire was used to collect data from sampled 322 respondents while interviews were used to collect data from nine participants. © 2020 The Author(s).

A distinctive feature to public libraries is the free and equal access they offer to the public and specifically caregivers of very small children. Libraries house large quantities of print and electronic resources that give children the opportunity to have meaningful literacy experiences that are necessary for reading development. These experiences have a significant impact on emergent literacy development. While literature demonstrates the importance of public libraries for small children, caregivers may not know about the impact of print-rich environments on emergent literacy skills.

The project is a case-study of the Central City Library makerspace (Auckland Libraries, New Zealand). The study collected evidence from documents, archival records, and interviewees. The findings revealed that while efforts are being made to assess the outcomes of makerspaces, methods and techniques are primarily informal. Current formal reporting relies upon quantitative measurement, such as visitor or participant numbers, which fails to capture the effects of the service on users. The implication is that staff may develop more structured and formalized approaches to assessing the outcomes of makerspaces. Further research could include the design of a prototypical outcomes assessment model that is then tested on a public library makerspace to determine the practicality of the approach. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Pia Margaret Gahagan and Philip James Calvert. ©, © Pia Margaret Gahagan and Philip James Calvert.","Auckland; evaluation; makerspaces; Outcomes assessment; performance measurement; programmes and services",01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073770157

Library Ranking Europe (LRE) is a pilot project which looks at public libraries from a customer perspective. The method is mystery shopping, anonymous visits to libraries. The aim is to create a ranking system that stimulates benchmarking. The ranking system consists of different factors–categories and subcategories–which reflect library services. In the evaluation, every category is scored. The LRE scale generates a ranking system that categorizes libraries according to the scores from one to six stars, from Poor to Exceptional. The system will be developed further but after five years of testing, we find that LRE offers a relatively easy way to compare public libraries in different European countries.

Positive word-of-mouth communication remains one of the most powerful tools used to develop mutually rewarding connections with the community. This article argues that libraries can harness the power of brand advocacy to transform their patrons into the most enthusiastic sharers of information, or informal brand advocates. Moreover, it emphasizes how libraries can carefully build and maintain mutually rewarding community connections through effective brand advocacy by utilizing the STEPPS framework–Social Currency, Triggers, Emotion, Public, Practical Value, Stories. Each principle in this framework can help an organization to effectively spread important brand messages. While the social currency principle encourages people to talk about topics that make them appear more favorable to others, triggers provide everyday cues that remind people of the library brand. Emotion focuses on appealing to feelings and the public principle calls for initiatives that advertise the brand. Finally, practical value motivates people to spread useful information and the stories principle explains that people share their experiences through memorable narratives.

In this information age and information economy era, easy and instant access to information and knowledge, which are inevitabilities for socio-economic development, cannot be overemphasised. With rolling out of public libraries even in disadvantaged rural communities due to the library conditional grant in South Africa, the study is aimed at investigating factors influencing the Internet access and use in public libraries in Limpopo. The study adopted a qualitative research approach. The twenty four users of three rural, semi-rural and urban public libraries were selected through convenience sampling. A well-placed government official of the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture was purposively selected. All informants were interviewed face to face to collect data. The study found that, although public libraries studied have networked computers for the Internet access and use, there are many challenges. The officials of the relevant department need to study the recommendations of this study to ensure that the people have digital access in public libraries to mitigate the diverse socio-economic challenges they are facing to improve their lives. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Samuel Maredi Mojapelo. ©, © Samuel Maredi Mojapelo.","Department of Arts and Culture; digital-divide; Internet access; public libraries; South Africa",01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067640647

Methodology: Data collection was done through two researcher-made questionnaires, one from the viewpoints of directors and one investigating the views of users. The questionnaires’ validity was done by four libraries and Information Science professionals, and the reliability was determined by the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. The statistical population of this research is made up of all directors and users of 12 public libraries of the city of Isfahan, one of the largest cities in Iran. Findings: In users’ viewpoints, the “interaction capability” is the most important feature that social media marketing can have in libraries. From the viewpoints of the directors, “creating a true picture of the role of the library” and “informing users about library services” are among the most important reasons for the marketing of libraries in the social media. From the perspective of both groups, the Telegram is the most appropriate medium for the marketing of library services. Results: To maintain their customers and their market position, libraries need to use more exciting tools such as social media for marketing. Library directors of this study emphasized on this fact and 79.1% of users expressed interest in receiving library information through social media. Value: The findings of this study would help the library directors to better decide on the marketing of their library services in social media.

The change to an attention economy is a challenge for the library as an institution because most aspects of the public library, from the library space to the organization of activities, are designed for a time when media were scarce and access to media was one of the most valuable services provided by the library. The changes in the media environment has resulted in increased competition for the libraries. Consequently, libraries need to adopt a market-oriented approach that, to a higher degree, incorporates user needs and preferences in the development of library services and activities. On a very general level, the market-oriented approach allows the library to not only focus on those groups of citizens that the library or its political stakeholders consider most important but also design services that are relevant for those groups. From a market-oriented perspective, the success of an organization depends on not only its ability to gauge user needs and market competition but also its ability to use that knowledge to provide superior service or develop better products–in short, to deliver superior value to its customers. The degree of market orientation in public libraries today roughly falls into one of three categories: product-oriented, sales-oriented, or market-oriented. The main focus of the product-oriented library is the collection, while the sales-oriented library focuses on promoting and selling existing library services. The market-oriented library is guided by user needs and preferences to develop library services. The transition towards market orientation requires a clear strategy and prioritization. Further, it requires a refocusing of the organization to core values and adapting the collection, activities, and services to user needs. Thus, the transition demands both changes in structure and in culture, as well as new skills for both staff and management. To operationalize the concept of market orientation, an iterative process with five distinctive phases is introduced. The five phases are organized as a process over a defined period with the following components: generation of market intelligence, knowledge sharing in the organization, selection of target groups and initiatives, development and organization, and evaluation. This five-phase model can be used as a tool to monitor and develop basic library operational procedures–such as logistics, procurement, service concepts, and collection development–in accordance with a market-oriented perspective. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Jakob Heide Petersen and Rie Bojer Kooistra.","Change management; library development; library strategy; market orientation",01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065838016

The development, presentation and upkeep of such school support services by public libraries are practically necessary to fulfill such collaboration. It is thought that web pages for school support services are essential to public library websites, not only in Japan but also in the U.S.A., in order to inform people, who are especially involved in education, about the existence of school support services and how to utilize them for school support. Also, it is essential for public libraries to provide users with web pages for school support services, children’s web pages, YA web pages, and web pages for promotion of reading on their own websites, in order to improve school education and social education in local community. Furthermore, a contents model of web pages for school support services is proposed through the results of our recent investigation into the contents of web pages for school support services. This contents model is composed of five kinds of material: (I) information on school support services, (II) information on resource sharing, (III) information on cooperative library programs, (IV) information resources on teaching support and the study of teaching materials for school teachers and staff of schools, (V) information resources on provisions for reading and improvements in student information literacy. © 2020 The Author(s).

TBPL applied this strategy to achieve a Blue Ocean Shift, using an analytical framework and tools: choose the right place to start with a Pioneer-Migrator-Settler Map; collectively build one simple picture that captures the current state of play with a Strategy Canvas; discover the pain points of patrons imposed by TBPL with a Buyer Utility Map; develop alternative strategic options that achieve differentiation and low cost with a Four Actions Framework; select a blue ocean move, conduct rapid market tests, and launch the move.

The authors selected this period because events, such as the 2016 U.S. presidential election, contributed to an increased national concern about media literacy. This study fills a research gap by providing a broader assessment of public library responses to this issue, as most of the published literature thus far stems from academic libraries. An electronic survey solicited data from both a stratified purposive sample and a self-selecting sample of public libraries throughout the United States (U.S.). Analysis of qualitative and quantitative data from sixty-five public libraries revealed several key themes related to media literacy initiatives, including types of initiatives developed, initiatives deemed most successful by staff, community response to initiatives, and reasons for not pursuing initiatives. Findings denote the current state of how public libraries address media literacy and offer practical guidance for those developing media literacy initiatives. Key findings are as follows: lack of staff time is the reason most often cited for not engaging in media literacy initiatives; more effective measurements are needed to assess both community needs and outcomes of library initiatives; “fake news” is a topic of interest in the community and among library staff; and there appears to be a relationship between staff interest in the topic and perceived interest on the part of the public, which may impact efforts to address the issue. Implications for practice resulting from those findings include engaging in initiatives that maximize service while minimizing staff time involvement; measuring and assessing community interests as well as outcomes of initiatives; using trending topics such as “fake news” to increase interest in library services; and continuing to increase staff awareness of and training in issues deemed important by the library community. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Suzanne S.

This has largely been the case since Andrew Carnegie developed his formula to build libraries for communities across North America in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Fast forward to the 21st century and our world has become increasingly interconnected and less predictable. Rapid change due to innovation and technology is the norm and as a result, we expect our buildings to adapt to these changes as seamlessly and immediately as possible. Across the built environment, we are finding ways to make buildings amenable to changing user groups. Schools absorb changes in pedagogy and enrollment. Commercial space adapts to changes in tenants and brand. Workplace environments evolve with technology, headcount and collaborative styles. As libraries continue to evolve, architecture will be at the forefront of solving real, functional issues for clients, while honoring everything libraries are trying to accomplish. At the same time, the design expression reflects the truly unique expectations we are now asking our buildings to solve. As architects, we can be your advocates in planning new facilities that are amenable to change, as well as existing facilities that require reimagining in order to meet new criteria. Through design, we meet these new challenges, while inspiring community connections in well built, well cared for and well loved spaces. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Ruth Baleiko. ©, © Ruth Baleiko.","Architecture; design; discovery spaces; learning spaces",01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062327963

In an attempt to actualize this goal, the role of public libraries in information provision to agricultural extension agents in Nigeria becomes paramount. This paper discusses provision of information to agricultural extension agents in a developing country. It starts with the concept of extension agents and the essence of information provision to them. It further discusses types, sources and challenges of public libraries in information provision to agricultural extension workers in a developing country. Some of the challenges are as follows: poor funding of public libraries, demotivated staff, and so on. Based on these discussions, the paper recommended adequate training and retraining of staff, adequate funding of public libraries by the federal, state and local government, the revitalization of the abandoned mobile library services among others. The paper therefore concludes that information provision to agricultural extension agents by public library is very crucial for national development. The current state of poverty, hunger and lack in Nigeria and some other African countries could be reduced to a great extent if current, relevant and up-to-date information are provided by libraries to the concerned agencies. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. ©, © Jerome Idiegbeyan-Ose, Ayotunde Owolabi, Chidi Segun-Adeniran, Ayooluwa Aregbesola, Sola Emmanuel Owolabi and Toluwani Eyiolorunshe.","agricultural extension agents; agricultural extension workers; Information provision; Nigeria; public library; rural farmers; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",01616846,,,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058214075

Unfortunately, it appears that for some libraries who have implemented evaluation, they have focused on metrics that do little to inform the library’s practice, do not demonstrate how a library contributes to its community, and do not assist public libraries in the enhancement of their operations. While traditional output metrics such as circulation, program attendance and technology use provide data about library activities, these metrics are simple counts that fall short in providing insight into why people visited the library, if they accomplished their goals during their visit, or what would have improved their visitor experience. In addition, this reliance on “empty metrics” has had the negative effect of leading stakeholders, policy-makers and funders to believe libraries are nothing more than book depositories. Empty metrics reinforce old and inaccurate stereotypes about public libraries and the role of librarians. We contend that we are at a turning point: evaluation practices are now successfully being embedded into day-to-day library operations and have become a part of library culture. The next step is to ensure libraries develop meaningful metrics that demonstrate the library’s social contribution, and then engage stakeholders to recognize the necessity of adopting these new metrics. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Bill Irwin and Kimberly Silk. ©, © Bill Irwin and Kimberly Silk.","Evaluation; metrics; public libraries; stakeholders",01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061436958

The idea was to reevaluate the book’s major message about the urgency of transforming librarianship–the discipline, the profession and the institutional forms–into a field that is “proactive”, client-centered, innovation-conscious, aggressive and well aware of societal needs. Today, a similar change and innovation agenda recurs in R. David Lankes’ redefinition of the role and mission of libraries and librarians in The New Librarianship: A Field Guide (2016). Another contemporary parallel is John Palfrey’s discussion of re-conceptualizing libraries as networked platforms pursued in Bibliotech: Why Libraries Matter More Than Ever in the Age of Google (2015).

Libraries are hiring staff with “customer experience” in their title, others are curious and want to learn more. Most of the resources currently available to libraries hoping to get started take a corporate approach particularly as it impacts financial success. The bottom line is that all of us are in the customer experience business, whether we know it or not. It goes to the heart of everything we do–how staff interact with the public and each other, the value libraries provide to a community, even the cleanliness of the restrooms. Additionally, many of those companies that library users experience in their daily lives–health care, insurance, retail–have already jumped on the customer experience bandwagon, overall raising the public’s expectation of what they should experience in libraries. How and where to start? How does a library build a road map to develop a customer experience philosophy and culture, which staff will embrace and support? When building a new library how do you design that building using a customer experience lens?

The statistical population consisted of parents whose children have used the library services of kids/teens libraries in the Isfahan City. Sample members were chosen by random sampling. SPSS23 and AMOS23 software were used for data analysis. Findings: The findings indicated that the two variables of marketing intelligence and risk-taking ability of the librarians have no direct, significant influence on user loyalty, while competitive advantage directly affects it. However, marketing intelligence and risk-taking ability can influence user loyalty if mediated through competitive advantage. Results: If the librarians of kids/teens libraries can use their marketing intelligence to take reasonable risks, they can create a competitive advantage in service provision.

It also examines the inequalities in access and use and suggests ways in which ICTs may be used to reduce the digital divide. A qualitative research methodology was adopted.

Traditional means of disposal such as taking books to the tip can mean a public relations disaster is lying in wait. As alternatives, libraries have given away books to organizations that will value them, or they can sell discarded items to generate revenue. Book sales have changed significantly with the widespread adoption of the Web because this creates a much larger potential market than could be reached with sales in the library.

Another option is to sell books to recycling companies because paper recycling is becoming much more widespread.

Part of this transformation is the way libraries are engaging entire families. Libraries are playing a stronger role than ever before in supporting families to promote children’s early literacy and reading skills (Celano and Neuman 2015; Nagle et al. 2016; Neuman and Celano 2010), stimulating adult learning (Boden and Tashijan 2015), creating initiatives to improve family health (Morgan et al. 2016), providing services to families with extreme challenges such as those experiencing poverty, homelessness, food insecurity, and incarceration (Holt and Holt 2010; Terille 2016), as well as becoming spaces for families, especially those who are recent immigrants, to build new relationships and social networks (Khoir et al. 2017; Vårheim 2014). Despite these efforts, few studies have specifically sought to understand the organizational dimensions that support family engagement within a library system and the potential that these efforts have in promoting children’s learning not only in the early years, but also into and throughout middle childhood and adolescence. Based on a yearlong study investigating the power of family engagement in public libraries, this article considers how libraries can begin to adopt a systemic approach to family engagement to further innovate the library space. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © M.

Why do people still visit public libraries in the digital age? While many factors drive people to visit public libraries, one thing that public libraries offer that cannot be duplicated online is physical space. Over the decades, library space has been the glue holding the library universe together even as the specific activities that take inside libraries have evolved. While public libraries do an excellent job of promoting their important role in providing access to information, educational resources, technology, and a host of valuable services, they must also promote the value of public library space itself. This requires more than trotting out numbers; it requires telling compelling stories of how public library space is used and reminding the public that the kind of spaces public libraries provide are, in fact, a vanishing resource. The post-911 tightening of security in public buildings of all sorts—coupled with the increasing privatization of what were once public spaces—has left public libraries as perhaps the last remaining indoor public spaces where an individual can remain from opening until closing without needing any reason to be there and without having to spend any money. Public libraries should promote the uniqueness of their spaces in much the same way that National Parks promote the unique spaces they preserve and make available to the public. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Donald A.

This framework has been developed by synthesizing the ideas of Karl Marx (“From each according to his ability and to each according to his needs”) and Abraham Maslow (The Hierarchy of Needs). This mixture of political science and psychology provides a new way of framing the challenge of cultural change in public libraries. It creates a solid conceptual and theoretical basis for the changes required to transform Traditional Libraries (which serve only 20% of the community) into libraries, which are Community Led (to reach 50%) and Needs Based (to reach 80% and beyond). This evaluation framework will enhance the understanding of public libraries; but to understand the world is not enough—we must also seek to change it.

The library offers a place for observing the culture of the new country from a distance to active participation; it is an arena for comfort and consolation in a difficult life situation as well as an arena for activity and participation. It provides support in developing friendships, acclimating to a new culture, learning a new language, and providing avenues to employment. Three mothers, who fulfilled the criteria for the study, were selected from an initial focus group. Women from Kurdistan, Mexico, and Indonesia were interviewed individually to gain an understanding on the issues brought forth in the focus group. They participated in interviews over the course of 6 months. These programs became a fortuitous blending of an established community with a group of families looking for a support community in a new country. This study has implications for institutions serving immigrants as they look to find a community of support, to learn English, and to acclimate to American culture as they create a comfortable identity that blends their home country with the new country. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Angela P.

That reality means that those concerned about young children in libraries have been about adaptation on a continuing basis. In this world of rapid change, innovation is constant: City firefighters come to the libraries in uniform to read stories to children, library outreach specialists take programs to daycare centers in their communities, and staff members create a space in a library devoted to early childhood reading.

This report examines how community engagement can connect Nova Scotia’s rural public libraries with their communities. Librarians from eight predominantly rural library systems across the province were interviewed regarding the community engagement practices currently being used within their libraries and how their patrons (particularly youth) were reacting and responding to these practices. This article synthesizes the information derived from these interviews and provides a summary of the community engagement efforts being made throughout Nova Scotia.

Overall, libraries have poor and outdated book collections that are not properly classified and cataloged. Information Communication Technology infrastructure exists in libraries with some exceptions. Most of the libraries are facing constraints (e.g., low number of hours, too small in size, and too many users for size of collections) that result in inadequate services. Most of the libraries are facing similar problems, which are being faced by other public libraries of Pakistan (e.g., shortage of professional staff, lack of modern facilities, and insufficient funds).

In recent decades the mayor and City Council of Los Angeles have supported the libraries that have come to define the great cultural heritage and a significant landmark in the heart of the city. The most recent budget shortfall—that which began in 2007—was brought on by huge, mandated increases in pension payments due to city workers’ funds, particularly in the police and fire departments. At LAPL the budget shortfall created severe personnel, material, and service cuts.

They are expected to explore channels of communication for the practice of true democracy. An emphasis on democratic ideals raises awareness of democratic tenets among the populace and also facilitates the holding of free, fair, and peaceful elections.

Over time, the amount of government information produced has increased significantly, and the rise of e-government has made access to online government information, communication, and services equally vital to participation in society and interaction with governments. However, the outlets of free public access to government information and e-government have constricted over time, leaving public libraries as one of the only free public Internet access points in most communities. As a result, public libraries serve as a social guarantor of access to and assistance with government information and e-government services. This article first discusses the historical evolution of the means of access to government information and changes over time in responsibilities in providing such access. After exploring the interrelationships between government information and e-government, the article then details the development of the role of public libraries as guarantors of e-government access. Finally, the article examines the impacts of policy on e-government access in libraries, leading to a set of recommendations and conclusions to support the vital library roles related to e-government. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","E-government; Government information; Law; Policy; Public access",01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957863315

The research was carried out originally in 2000, but the study still informs policy makers in the Singapore system. Three main research questions are explored: • What are the information needs of wheelchair-bound young people? • What are their perceptions of libraries and library services? • What are the problems they face in using library facilities and services? The study involves eleven wheelchair-bound people between the ages of twelve and twenty who were selected by means of a purposive sample. Findings indicate that most participants enjoyed reading books but did not read newspapers. The computer was used primarily as a recreational tool, and the convenience of the Internet appealed to them. There were, however, problems in using computer equipment in the libraries. School libraries were generally inaccessible. There were also problems in using public library services and facilities as well as being in public places. Their use of public libraries was infrequent. They were unaware of the full range of library facilities and services. The study concluded that there was a need and demand for library services by wheelchair-bound young people. Their information needs and reading habits were no different from those of any young person. Current library promotions were inadequate in stimulating or sustaining their awareness and interest. Transportation was the main obstacle in getting to libraries. The problems faced in using libraries were mainly related to architectural and physical access to library facilities and services. © Ivan Chew Boon Leong and Susan E.

This article addresses the issue of why the Internet matters for public libraries, both in terms of impacts on the general public, particularly the digitally disadvantaged (part one of the article) and impacts on libraries themselves (part two of the article). Each part of this report begins with an extensive literature review, followed by a data analysis section. In part one, the author uses the 2000 United States Census dataset to evaluate library efforts to bridge the digital divide, by analyzing differences in the growth of public terminals in library systems serving counties with different levels of household income, households in poverty, non-white households, and non-English-speaking households. The analysis finds no disparity in the number of public computers available in areas with high and low incomes but finds a significant-and widening-disparity in the number of computers available in areas with a higher versus lower percentage of non-white and non-English-speaking households. In part two of the report, the author uses a random effects linear regression model to estimate the effects of Internet access on library usage. This analysis finds that having Internet terminals (versus having no Internet terminals) has a significant positive effect on a library's visits and reference transactions, but not on a library's circulation. An increase in the number of Internet terminals has no significant effect, positive or negative, on visits, reference transactions, or circulation. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Computers; Digital divide; Internet; Public libraries",01616846,,,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953401835

Drawing on international examples, direct mailings, and a telephone survey, this paper examines that effort to win back what Kerr termed ""lapsed borrowers."" Kerr's research confirms that libraries can win back a significant proportion of ""lapsed borrowers."" The most effective method was for the library to contact customers directly and to offer them a ""freebie."" Kerr presents cost data to demonstrate that the effort to win back lapsed users is cost effective. The lapse rate was reduced to just 33 percent. According to Kerr, lapsed borrowers should be the main target group for any new marketing drive.

Library dependence on computers has increased users' belief that librarians should be able to help them save time. The extent of that expectation can be seen in the way that users involve libraries in their efforts to ""satisfice"" their research including materials browsing. These expectations about time mean that users bring high expectations when they interact with librarians. They expect librarians to be expert in many fields.

The researchers constructed a survey, based on a successful model used with libraries serving Spanish-speaking populations and applied it to the Michigan libraries in the counties with a significant Arab-speaking population.

To bring more users to the public library, they recommended that the building needed increased seating to support training, education and in-house cultural programming. The stories cited in this article suggest that there is a relationship between learning spaces and collaborative technology. Among librarians and library planners, learning spaces are seen as a unifying requirement for the expansion of library services. They recognize that the library's seating plan must include more learning spaces to support social networking, sharing and project base learning.

The purpose of the 2007 survey was to look for changes and ask questions about community partnerships, staffing, and financial information. The researchers found many similarities between the surveys but a number of distinct changes in behavior and attitudes emerged. These included the shift towards viewing the library as more of a service than a repository of materials, increased dissatisfaction with pay and economic issues; an increase in MLS degree holders; and a trend towards the library being viewed as less vital to the community. The 2007 results showed that almost half of rural libraries engage in community partnerships and that the average rural librarian earns less than $12/hour and has an operating budget of less than $30,000. The changes and results are analyzed along with suggestions for future research.","Changes; Future; Librarianship; Libraries; Rural; Surveys",01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61549141302

It adds detail to his longstanding argument that the environmental majority is mendaciously optimistic in suggesting that new-and sometimes still uninvented-technology will solve the world's food and energy problems. Jackson lays out statistics on how fast the world is using up its energy sources, noting that biofuels such as agriculture-based ethanol will provide insufficient energy to power U.S. cars and trucks even if we use all of the food in the world to produce motive power. Jackson's previous article, ""Conceptual Revolutions: Who Needs Them? Why?"" was published in Public Library Quarterly 24-3 (2005). The two articles form an intertwined statement on world resource limitations and opportunities. These articles were selected for inclusion in PLQ for the fundamentally different view they offer library professionals on the biofuels-and-ecology debate, in the hopes of balancing competing points of view in library collections. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

Compared to extensive research on male and female differences in reading, computer use or within the context of the school library, there is relatively little descriptive research showing the library preferences of adult men and women. This study analyzed over 1,200 user responses in a survey conducted as part of a strategic planning process of an affluent public library. Male patrons in many respects were simply below-average in many areas (fewer visits, fewer services or resources used) but also showed distinctly different choices in a few areas, mainly related to electronic and business-related items. They also are almost completely uninterested in children's areas, a sharp contrast with adult female patrons). Male usage is distinct enough to warrant special attention from library planners. The results help library managers understand better what different patrons already use, and those areas where greater marketing or different strategic choices may be needed. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

She edited and rewrote that original presentation for publication in PLQ. Much of Kaplan's method involves a rigorous analysis of the same data that the NEA report writers used. However, she demonstrates, contrary to the organizational researchers' conclusions, that voluntary reading rates among teenagers and young adults did not decline between the early 1970s and 2004. Neither, Kaplan finds, is there any reliable data to support the NEA's editorial claims about the declining proficiency in adult readers. She concludes that the NEA authors truncated the time dimension of the available data and otherwise manipulated or misinterpreted data to obtain their results. Kaplan concludes that library professionals should discount the highly publicized NEA findings and focus on the clear statistical realities reported on the source documents and summarized here instead. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.","Adult literacy; Literacy; National Endowment for the Arts; Reading rates; Statistical analysis; Teen reading; To Read or Not to Read",01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60449088343

This mission has even included the goal of changing society, especially by enhancing egalitarian access to democratic participation. Such an ambitious goal requires a deep and clear understanding of politics in the United States, and particularly of democracy. This paper includes a review of some of the challenges that accompany an understanding of what democracy is and how it is practiced today, with the objective of initiating a conceptual reform in public librarianship. A revised taxonomy of essential ideas is proposed here as a step towards accomplishing the goal of changing society. © 2007 by The Haworth Press.

This study was conducted for the U.S. National Commission on Library and Information Science (NCLIS) as part of a larger survey of library assessment instruments. HAPLR ratings are based upon public library data available from the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The paper examines promotion of the HAPLR rating method and construction of its scores, summarizes literature on library input and output measures, reviews published criticisms, identifies other key shortcomings of the method, and explores selected statistical trends in NCES public library data from 1999 through 2004. The article concludes that imprecision in HAPLR scores renders the method unsuitable for quantitatively assessing comparative and individual library performance. Statistical validity of the method has never been demonstrated. Input/output data that HAPLR uses are inadequate measures of library performance and quality. The scores are susceptible to inaccuracies in the compilation of NCES data. Promoters of the HAPLR methodology should fully disclose the limitations and biases of the method. These limitations also need to be understood and heeded by the public library community, which has injudiciously joined its national library identity with a statistically unsound portrayal of its collective and individual institutional strengths and weaknesses. © 2007 by The Haworth Press.

This research study responds to this lack of statistics. Using a survey questionnaire, the researcher gathered data on ADA accommodations made by the entire system of 48 South Carolinian public libraries and their 137 branches in three categories: (I) Physical Access; (II) Collections and Services, and (III) Users, Staff, and Policymaking. One hundred and six (57.29%) libraries completed the questionnaire. After testing their answers for statistical significance, the researcher concluded that South Carolinian public libraries made the greatest degree of accommodation in the area of physical access, with some shortcomings in terms of telephones, service desks, alarms and signs, toilet mirrors, and urinals. In contrast, urgent improvements are needed in Category II and Category III, which competed for the position of least compliance. Specifically, a majority of the libraries need to conduct user surveys to identify people with disabilities in their communities and to develop written policies related to the needs of these people. While formulating these, special attention should be given to the provision of special services and staff training, as well as to assistive devices to access both digital and non-electronic materials. The researcher also tested three hypotheses about possible correlates between library's location, (re)construction date and type on one hand and its ADAcompliance on the other. The data showed that the (re)construction date had the most impact, with post-1992 libraries providing greater physical access. Of importance was also the library's location, with rural libraries being less ADA compliant in terms of their toilet facilities, drinking fountains, provision of materials in alternative formats, special services, and staff training. The variable of the library being a main or branch library had little effect on its accessibility. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The combination of a lack of international market awareness of many of Panama's native tree species, a young plantation forestry industry, and virtually non-existent industrial wood processing capacity have kept Panama's forest products exports, including certified wood products, to a minimum. In summary, on both the supply and demand sides of the equation, a host of socio-cultural, institutional, and economic obstacles prevent landowners from pursuing certification programs for forest management and production of non-timber forest products. As a result, national and international markets for certified Panamanian forest products remain virtually unexplored business opportunities. To develop markets for certified forest products from Panama, a host of policy alternatives might be considered, including informational campaigns and extension programs for local landowners, incentive packages to defray initial costs of certification, and investments in international marketing campaigns coupled with investments in developing local manufacturing capacity and infrastructure.

High expectations for bioprospecting peaked in 1991 when Costa Rica's INBio program reached a signature deal with Merck Pharmaceuticals. But hopes have waned as bioprospecting has yielded few promising compounds and little in the way of conservation benefits. This paper examines the potential for bioprospecting to contribute to conservation efforts, both broadly and within the specific context of Panama. Today, global markets for bioprospecting services stand at an estimated $60 million per year. A new model for bioprospecting, exemplified by Panama's ICBG project, may be emerging, one that takes a more business-oriented approach to finding drugs. By using ecological insights to guide sample collection, monetizing compounds earlier, and leveraging institutional clout, ICBG Panama may be increasing its odds of scientific success and contributing to conservation in non-monetary ways. I argue that in addition, ICBG Panama, its funders, and other bioprospectors must increase the scale of their operations if they are to create sustainable entities in the Darwinian world of drug discovery. Finally, I make specific policy recommendations for improving the supply and demand of bioprospecting in Panama and globally. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Conservation financing provided by non-Panamanian sources is used as a proxy for investigating the nature of the market for the existence value of biodiversity. Debt-for-nature swaps and environmental trust funds, such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), provide examples of demand in this market. This paper examines trends and policies that could change the cost of supplying biodiversity protection and factors that could improve or undermine demand for the existence value of biodiversity. If ecological restoration receives as much support within the conservation community as protection of pristine areas has in the past, then demand in this market is likely to remain strong. The largest challenge for this market will be shifting to the provision of biodiversity conservation by private landowners rather than solely by the national government.

In theory, markets for ecosystem services could encourage more extensive reforestation and ensure that reforestation efforts provide more than just timber. The most relevant ecosystem markets for the PCW are carbon sequestration, watershed services, and four biodiversity markets-bioprospecting, certification of biodiversity friendly products, ecotourism, and existence value. This paper examines the possibility for a land owner or land manager to participate in two or more of these markets. Two land use scenarios- native forest plantation and small-holder agroforestry-emerge as likely candidates for participation in multiple ecosystem service markets. These scenarios are examined to determine whether the strength of incentives to provide a bundle of timber and ecosystem services is sufficient to encourage expansion of these land uses with the Panama Canal Watershed.

Sustainable tourism-one market tool that potentially supports biodiversity services-aims to balance the environmental, economic, and socio-cultural features of tourism development by maintaining environmental resources, the socio-cultural livelihoods of host communities, and providing stakeholder benefits (WTO, 2004). Proponents claim that sustainable tourism contributes toward maintaining biodiversity, while critics fear that marketing various components of biodiversity as distinct services (e.g., only protecting unique places for sustainable tourism, and only protecting extremely biodiverse places for bioprospecting), fails to protect the integrity of the functioning, and dynamic ecosystem (Landell-Mills and Porras, 2002). This chapter serves as one section of a four-part analysis of existing and emerging markets for biodiversity services using Panama as a case study. Based on projections of future sustainable tourism markets, this analysis presents policy options that could positively augment future sustainable tourism ventures.

Yet formal markets for ecosystem services in Panama are poorly developed. We assume that functioning markets for ecosystem services would partially counter development pressures on Panama's natural forests and ecosystems, and propose a suite of policy alternatives that could help develop such markets with the expectation that revenues would fund conservation and restoration efforts. These recommendations fall into five broad categories: (1) increase conservation of existing forests; (2) promote reforestation; (3) strengthen institutional capacity; (4) lower transaction costs; and (5) build the Panama brand for environmental services. A variety of fiscal, legal, organizational, and information-based approaches are recommended. In addition, we recommend convening a national Ecosystem Services Task-Force to organize diverse stakeholders and implement policy alternatives deemed most appropriate for advancing market development. We emphasize policy alternatives that are consonant with political and economic conditions in the country, that leverage outside funding, that recognize political feasibility, and that build upon existing legal and institutional frameworks.

First, themarkets in Panama are dominated by the Panama Canal Authority and by timber revenues. Any strategy for expanding ecosystem services markets will have to reflect these realities. Second, while the scientific and business components of the framework we used to analyze these markets covered all the key points, more work needs to be done on the policy component. Articulating a simple, yet effective approach for developing policy recommendations to improve ecosystem services markets in context remains a key need. Third, valuable lessons were learned about ensuring that the students capture the maximum benefits from an international, clinically-based field trip.

Libraries help make possible the democratic public sphere ideal in the form of rational organization of human cultural production and they embody an essential element of democracy: A place where the ideal of unfettered communication and investigation exists in rudimentary form, hosting the turbulent discourse of a democracy and its culture. However, the trend of viewing and running libraries along business and profit models-""the new public philosophy""-represents a dismantling of the democratic public sphere. This can be seen in examples as varied as the rhetorical shift from ""patron"" to ""customer,"" the current struggles for funding and the justifications used in that process, to coffee bars, no retrospective collections, and the bias toward economically-useful electronic resources. The article ends with the argument that, if we forget this role and reason for being and abandon public purposes, then we are helping in the demise of the democratic public sphere and cutting away at the long-term justification for libraries.

This paper outlines the numerous pieces of the public library data puzzle and how those pieces might be assembled into an analytical statistical framework useful to practitioners and researchers. The pieces are the different consumers of library data, who have a variety of uses for data, and the different official collectors of library data, who have a variety of purposes in collecting data.

Keeping the Orange County Library System's (OCLS) website current for today's patron needs is a challenge that requires regular attention. Building design mock-ups, getting staff comment and organizing content involves preparation and time. From creating templates to integrating content, the website redesign is an opportunity to build from the ground up, incorporating new technology to display information in an innovative way. Spreading the workload throughout the system means more time for the digital content staff to create new digital products. This is accomplished by allowing staff to maintain dynamic and static web pages through database management, XML, and Contribute. By employing Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) the website could be adjusted by others and still maintain a common appearance. Using CSS also made the site lighter and more compact which allowed the harvesting of robust statistics. By using some of the reports in the new statistics software, parts of the website have already been changed.

The study is based on an analysis of 3,318 books that were published in Israel in the course of thirty years (1967–1997). It emerges that in Israel, as in the Western world in general, there has been an increase in the number of these books, which aim at helping people cope better with life. A categorization of the books shows that half of them deal with psychology (50%), the rest with health (30%) and spirituality (20%). In the field of psychology, most of the books focus on basic social and personal problems; in the field of health, most of them deal with alternative medicine; and in the field of spirituality, most of the books center on mysticism and particularly on futurology. It was found that the main increase in the publication of self-help books in Israel occurred in the years 1988–1997, during which 62% of all the books located in the course of the study were published. If the public libraries will understand the importance of these books and build attractive “self-help sections,” they can strengthen their position as a social institution in the new “information society.” © 2000 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

On July 19, 2001, the South Carolina State Library Board of Trusters voted unanimously not to implement the provision of the Proviso. Within 24 hours of the decision by the State Library Board of Trustees, the leadership of the South Carolina State Legislature threatened to sue the State Library to comply with the law, and to have all the appointed State Library Trustees and the State Librarian removed from their appointed positions. The conflict between the South Carolina State Library and the South Carolina State Legislature over funding of local public libraries signals a change in the relationship between State Library agencies and local public libraries.

This paper draws on the results of a qualitative English study broadly concerned with young people's information behavior to explore how youngsters locate non-fiction books within such libraries. One of several approaches was taken. Familiar with the placement of materials on the subject of the need, some went directly to the appropriate part of the collection. Others did not know the position of the desired section and combed the shelves randomly, consulted labels on the shelves/walls, sought help from staff or exploited the subject index. Most users wanted information on a certain topic, not a particular item. There were high levels of ignorance of both library terminology and the arrangement of books within the building. The article concludes by making recommendations for both practice and future research, based on the investigation's findings. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Findings suggest that the number of advertised youth services positions is increasing, and job titles are changing from the specific “children's services” to the more generalized “youth services.” Advertised responsibilities of the youth services librarian have consistently emphasized collection management and administrative duties, and many advertisements place a heavy emphasis on personality traits. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Rather, the difference is what happens in the summer. Children from high-income families make better progress in reading over the summer, and over time the summer advantage can account for social-class differences in reading achievement. There is a simple explanation for this difference: Children from high-income families read more over the summer, and they read more because they have more access to books, not only at home but outside the home as well. Studies show that public libraries offer inferior collections and services to children of poverty. An obvious way to increase access to books over the summer is to improve public library services. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Public referendums allow citizens to vote on library budgets, chartering, and bond issues but they need to be managed carefully by library administrators. This research analyzed telephone and e-mail interviews with a purposive sample of 13 library directors in New York State, looking at the reasons these directors gave for moving funding of libraries from line items in municipal budgets to special public tax jurisdictions. These directors also discussed methods they used to gain public support for votes that increased funding, including timing of votes, managing public relations, use of friends of the library, benefits that accrued to the public and library staff, and continued planning for the future of their libraries. Their stories and lessons generalize well to all libraries that need to create constituent support for increased resources. © 2000 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

In defining the role of young adult librarians at the institutional and national levels, it is necessary to consider the leadership role that is necessary to achieve the vision in the professional specialty in public libraries. The research presented here addresses the importance of the leadership role of young adult librarians and the extent to which graduate library and information science (LIS) programs provide the leadership education needed by young adult librarians. Generally, the research results indicate that a small number of LIS programs offer coursework in leadership or require those specializing in young adult services to take courses in the related area of management. Thus, there is greater likelihood that few YA librarians will receive leadership education. And, there is the need to consider the extent to which they will be able to take on leadership roles in fulfilling the missions of their employing organizations. © 2000 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

This special site constitutes a fascinating example of the integration of needs and activities. The site enables lending books by e-mail and bringing them into the home itself. It exposes the residents to search engines, as well as community and social sites in the world and in Israel, and offers guidance on how to make use of them. With the help of the site the library has also opened a virtual reference department, where residents can turn to the expert librarian with specific questions. With the site's help the library has become a community center for supplying specialized information, as well as a tool of social and cultural integration for the whole region. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Most public libraries, however, do not aggressively market this niche. Precedence is given to marketing the library as an educational and cultural institution. This role has had a long and dominant history. Traditionally, public perceptions of the library and other factors have made it difficult to broaden library marketing to focus on other information segments. Over time, this bias erodes the viability and relevance of the public library since other organizations usurp the niche.

Location of books, types of shelving, and displays were noted for both fiction and informational books, and unobtrusive observations of young children browsing were conducted in three of the libraries. The findings confirmed children's preference for books in eye level face front shelving in high traffic areas especially near the children's area seating; most children did not explore far from parents. Visits by children to hardcover fiction, paperback fiction, and paperback informational picture books, were balanced. However, hardcover informational picture books were missed due to less accessible locations, oversize shelving, and fewer displays. The role of accompanying parents in finding materials was pivotal. Improving access for young children to a wide variety of books in their public libraries supports both recreational and educational needs, and needs to be considered in library layout. © 2001 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

People need different types of information in their day-to-day life and their information seeking behaviour also differs from person to person. In India, 70 percent of the population lives in rural areas. The access the rural population has to information sources is very limited. Libraries, in addition to other sources, form a major source of information. However, the libraries in rural areas, as observed from earlier studies, are traditional in nature and not well equipped to effectively cater to the information needs of the rural people. Non-existence of library legislation in various states of India is one of the factors which adversely affected the development of a library system. This present study examines the status of rural libraries in four states of India, the information needs of the people in the study area, and their information seeking behaviour. The study also examines the role of the latest IT techniques in improving the present status of rural libraries. This study concludes that the libraries existing presently in rural areas are in a poor state of affairs. Lack of adequate resources, financial and human, is identified as the major reason for the present status of rural libraries. As far as information needs, a majority of respondents look for information relating to development schemes, employment opportunities, education, health, etc. Mass media including newspaper, TV, and radio are the major sources of information, followed by relatives/friends, and government officials. This study suggests the transformation of existing libraries or establishing a new set up of dynamic information centres with the help of the latest IT to effectively cater to the information needs of the rural people. © 2001 by The Haworth Ress, Inc.

This paper discusses elements of the reference interview and describes measures that can be taken to avoid personal liability while directing patrons to health information resources. © 2000 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Worldwide, the disease threatens to gravely impact a wide range of developing nations, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia and South America. In the United States, the poor and particularly women of color are at great, and increasing, risk for infection. Public libraries, as trusted public institutions for the dissemination of information, can continue to play an important role in promoting public health information surrounding HIV/AIDS prevention and education. Public libraries are not immune, however, to the political and value-driven public discourse surrounding HIV infection. Through carefully identifying the issues, taking a nonjudgmental service approach, and building collaborations with community based organizations, public libraries can become common ground for providing proactive prevention-focused information services. This article examines the current state of epidemic HIV/AIDS infection, reviews the literature on public library responses, and identifies highly select consumer health and biomedical monographic, serial, audio-visual and Web-based HIV/AIDS information tools. © 2000 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The easy explanation is that, because of the wide variety of documents available on the Net, the average person (with proper connectivity) may be his or her own librarian. The response to this situation is provoking concern in the library community over developing new means of counting reference transactions and alerting staff to expect more detailed questions to be asked in the future. For someone looking for proof to validate the above, one can provide no more than anecdotal evidence. This, however, is really not crucial to the intent of this commentary. As a statement, it serves rather as a metaphor of things to come. The purpose of this essay is to suggest other ways in which library services -particularly those of the public library - are potentially being “downsized” because they are now a part of a networked environment, i.e., of the Internet.

This information falls into two categories: medical information, and supportive information such as literature and poetry. This article discusses the problematic situation of libraries and of information for patients in Israeli hospitals, and raises the question of the public library being a possible solution to help people in need get the information they are entitled to. The conclusions are based on a survey conducted in 1994. The results are rather disappointing: only 26.3% of the hospitals have library services for patients; most of them are managed by volunteers who have no training in professional librarianship. Also, in terms of book acquisition policy, library activities, and criteria for lending books, most of the results indicate that much needs to be done to improve the situation and help the health consumer receive information and support through the library. As it is clear that the situation in hospitals is not going to change in the near future, it is suggested that the public library serve as a helping resource outside the hospital and by that action it would not only contribute to society but expand its functions and strengthen its position in the community. © 1999 by The Haworth Ress, Inc.

An examination of the book and magazine holdings, the facilities, the reading programs offered, the staff available, and the funding provided reveal that significant disparities exist. Although Beverly Hills serves a community twice the size of Santa Fe Springs, the Beverly Hills Public Library offers four times as many children and adolescent books and has four times as many reading programs as the Santa Fe Springs Library. In terms of the facilities, staff, and funding, the Santa Fe Springs Library lags far behind Beverly Hills. With these stark differences, students in poor and working-class neighborhoods are unlikely to have access to the books in their community, access necessary to develop high levels of literacy. © 1999 by The Haworth Ress, Inc.

The paper first describes key terms and explores the notion of a “public good” as it pertains to library services. Based on a number of studies, the paper offers a typology of public library impacts and the importance of those impacts for local communities. Specific types of impact are identified and described with emphasis on the importance of impacts on local economic development. The paper concludes by discussing a number of issues and strategies that should be considered when public librarians wish to promote economic development as an outcome from library services. © 1999 by The Haworth Ress, Inc.

The former appeals to natural, inalienable rights and the latter to American democracy in the attempt to fight censorship. Erosion of freedom of speech during the Reagan-Bush era suggests that we should try to reconcile the two positions by abandoning the appeal to American democracy. The Freedom to Read statement represents ideas elaborated by Alexander Meiiklejohn and Thomas I. Emerson in the early 1960s. However, later attacks on these positions by Robert H. Bork and Lillian R. BeVier show that the Constitution can be legitimately interpreted in a way that would allow much censorship of expression. Thus an appeal by the ALA to more abstract principles is in order. © 1999 by The Haworth Ress, Inc.

It has become imperative that libraries study the usage of their periodicals collections. It is no longer feasible to hold a title because someone might request it in the far future. Libraries need to critically evaluate the usage of their serials. They should consider dropping expensive titles that are requested only a few times a year and investigate titles that are more popular and used regularly. There seems to be an abundance of published articles concerning periodical usage for academic libraries. It is rare to find articles written by librarians in public libraries. If public librarians are not studying the usage of periodicals/serials it is important that they begin. If they are tracking the usage of their collections they should publish their findings.

This article addresses both completely automated and completely non-automated technical services departments, but it focuses on partially automated departments in small libraries. The selection of the measurements to make is a very important decision. The benefits of carefully selecting the measurements to make include better data for report writing, planning, and evaluations of various technical services functions.

This new section will be organized by a new Social Information Scientist who will be aware of the social needs of the public as well as new information technologies. A survey conducted in Israel in 1994, made clear that there is an awareness of the need for a self-help section in most libraries. Some librarians (67.5%) have such a section but most of them do not have a special policy for choosing books. Almost 40% of the readers expressed interest in this new section, but there is a lot to be done yet in order to utilize the potential of such a section and meet the needs of the public. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84998143999

This examination of the roots of this now accepted aspect of the public library landscape is presented in three sections. In the first of these the background of the twin concepts, a Federal agency and Federal aid for public libraries, is recounted. Outlined as well are the arguments of the leading opponents who were able to delay the A.L.A. Council's final endorsement for a year. The next segment will consider the Congressional fate of the twin concepts-the Federal agency easily approved, the concept oFFederal aid never attaining the status of serious consideration. Finally, the role of the Federal government in dispensing aid to public libraries, as part of the general effort against the depression, will be related. In the post-World II era the A.L.A. would renew its fight for Federal aid with the secure endorsement of the profession's largest organization, a degree of familiarity with the Congress and its ways, and five years actual experience in a Federal aid program. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84917288364

When Christianity became the political force in Europe, the clergy continued to collect and protect materials. The beginnings of public libraries in Europe during the 1600s and in America during the middle of the nineteenth century, gave rise to a new literacy among the general population. However, the upsurge in technology threatens to spawn a new class of “information access illiterate” people.

It outlines a different way of thinking about funding libraries, an innovative framework that will interest legislators in the plight of their under-funded library services. Wilson and Waters refer to this new structure as a “Library Authority”. The concept would allow the question of funding to go directly to the voters, who are those most concerned with the quality of libraries. This quality is also addressed by Waters, who considers quantity and volume as a faulty line of reasoning for gathering support. “We make little mention of the long-term impact associated with introducing a four-year old to the world of books… or to the economic impact derived from helping a saleswoman locate a new market for her products”.

Nevertheless, while these reactions are quite understandable, a close reading of recent censorship research suggests that they are not solutions. The purpose of this article is to explore the reasons why this kind of avoidance behavior-“censorproofing”-is eventually doomed to failure, and to suggest alternative strategies that might make more effective use of the time, energy, imagination, and resources of public library staff. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002011289

Also, determining which journals provide the greatest coverage of the EC could b;? useful information--for library collection development and serials review. To accomplish these goals, Business Periodicals Index and Social Sciences Index were examined for the decade 1983-1992.

The findings showed that most respondents perceived that they would receive positive consequences if they were to engage in the activities. Results also suggest that there is a limited set of salient consequences for each activity, and some consequences are common across a number of activities. In the second stage, a mail questionnaire was used to quantify perceptions of the ""goodness"" of the consequences and the likelihood of their occumng. Generally, the results confirmed the qualitative findings and showed that most consequences were perceived to be positive and likely to occur. © 1996 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

He recalls finding sanctuary as a child in his small hometown public library and his first encounter, in the 1950’s, with the economically disadvantaged as patrons of Ulat library. He notes the economic and social forces which, beginning in the late 1960’s. produced a significant population of homeless Americans. Among these were the de-institutionalization movement, the economic expulsion of the poor from the housing market, the shrinking job market, and the rise of substance abuse. All of these phenomena, he suggests, have transformed the public library from a sanctuary to a shelter. In that context he discusses recent court cases centering around the first amendment guarantees of access for the homeless and disturbed to public libraries and recalls, anecdotally, his own experiences as library director in Beverly Hills, CA, with representatives of this growing population. Though not necessarily economically disadvantaged, both youth (particularly latchkey youth) and Ule elderly are similarly disenfranchised by society and become he special, de faco charges of the public library. Finally, the author discusses the changes in societal structure which revisions to immigration laws have introduced and concludes that the library must serve a new role of social cohesion in a time when much of the rest of society seem to be falling apart He challenges librarians to more pro-actively cooperate with other social and community agencies as advocates for the disadvantaged and to maintain Ule library as neutral enter for increasingly diverse communities, concluding that in Ulis way the public library can confinuc to play a vital role as a sanctuary and a refuge which is truly free (i.e., open) to all. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862308484

So intense is this involvement that the user doesn't merely witness or observe the experience from the sidelines, but actually and actively lives it.

Major findings of the study were the following: (1) Most respondents (66.15%) reported having appointed staff members for services to older people. (2) Only 4.6% of the responding libraries documented policy statements concerning library services for older people. (3) Only 27.69% of the respondenls initiated projects and programs exclusively for older people. (4) More than eighty percent (83.08%) of the respondents had one or more older volunteer workers.

The research tools were questionnaires that were filled in by users studying at the reference rooms, and observations that were made in order to build a behavioral map of these reference rooms users. A clear preference to choose seats in the peripheral parts of the library was revealed. The reasons given for seating preference were quiet, privacy, and ability to concentrate. Most of those who come alone tended to choose seats at an empty desk. Forty-four percent of those who came to study came with a friend(s) -a phenomenon that is common among adolescents. However, those who came accompanied also preferred hidden and peripheral seats. Therefore, there is a need for varied, separated, small study areas scattered through the reference room. Also, the differences between modular and fixed-function libraries were studied. No difference was found in seating preferences. However, differences appeared in the clients' perceptrons of the room space, in problems with noise and movement of people and in greater exposure of the clients in modular hbraries to other activities and services of the library. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953970696

Overall, reviews are less important than non-review sources.

It is felt, however, when the evidence is collected, in most cases, out-of-school adults will be better served with a formal bibliographic instruction program. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010938878

Establishing a local history collection has both short- and long-term implications concerning library policies, space allocation, staff time, staff training, and budgets. Because of this, -. the small public library should clearly and realistically establish a collection policy which will not place an undue burden on its re- sources. Assessing community needs is a critical part of this pro- cess. Small public libraries should not attempt to duplicate or com- pete with other institutions for local material. Rather, the library should seek to fill the void in public service in cases where there is no extant collection available to the public. © 1988 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Theorists of the women's movement have begun redefining the issue of pornography, however, as one of an in- fringement of women's civil rights, rather than one of free speech. One result of this redefinition is a crop of proposed new ordinances giving women the right to bring a civil suit against the producers and distributors of pornography. These ordinances would include li- braries as distributors of pornography.

Over half of the 379 respondents had three-dimen- sional objects in the collections, the most popular categories being toys and games, and tools and household items. Local code or practice was the most frequent basis for cataloging, but AACR2 was cited next most frequently by those libraries cataloging both three-dimensional and audiovisual materials. Staff size was significant negatively: the libraries with 1-5 staff persons were least likely to catalog nonprint materials of any type. The author suggests that increased use of AACR2 and cooperative cataloging of nonprint formats will enhance public library collections both as to quality and accessibility. © 1985 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Significant differences in the distribution of library service among neighborhoods within the same city have been reported. No clear pattern of intentional discrimination against low income and non-white neighborhoods in the provision of library service could be discerned, but inequitable library service was found in all of them. However, such inequitable library service distribution is caused by ""unpatterned inequality"" and bureaucratic decision rules. Public library directors must incorporate equity considerations into the day-today workings of the public library and guidelines are suggested. © 1984 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The bulk of the paper, however, reviews research done during the last quarter-century in public libraries to determine whether any evidence has been found to support claims that demand-oriented public libraries are filled with materials of dubious quality. While a great deal has been written on the quality versus demand issue, the author notes that much of it is rhetoric only; the research itself is scanty, in part due to the complexities of defining and measuring quality. However, three factors are identified which have been assumed to affect collection quality: the financial resources the library devotes to book purchases, the educational background of individual selectors, and the degree of contact such selectors have with the public. The author reviews studies relating to these factors and concludes that to date, there is no evidence to corroborate the belief that the quality of books in demand-oriented libraries is less than that of their qualityoriented counterparts.

Because early library emphasis on raising popular taste has lessened and adult education efforts within libraries have diminished, libraries are often held responsible for the novelists' plight. In addition, adult education in general has moved from an emphasis on the liberal arts to a concentration on practical, ""how-to"" courses. The Great Book Discussion Program was the last major liberal arts adult education effort sponsored by a library. A program for discussion of subsidized quality new fiction is pro- posed. Novelists would be subsidized by library purchases. Such discussion groups would sometimes appear on a related public television show. The plan would provide fiction with a springboard other than publishers' promotions and literary establishment endorsements. © 1978 by The Haworth Press, All rights reserved.",,01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954964156

The main purpose was to determine the effectiveness of three types of public library story hour programs in the acquisition of receptive language (listening skills) of children three, four, and five years of age. Subjects were randomly assigned to a ""live"" story hour; a 16mm commercially-produced film story hour: a video-taped story hour produced during the ""live""; or to a control group. One-way analysis of covariance with two covariates (age in months and pretest Test of Basic Experiences, (TOBE) 2, Language) indicated significant differences existed among treatment groups. Both the ""live"" and the film treatments were significantly more effective than no story hour; and the ""live"" was significantly more effective than the video treatment. A second rest-i.e.-a story protocol-was not sensitive to differences between treatment groups. © 1978 by The Haworth Press, All rights reserved.",,01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954940375

Since World War Il, structured cooperation, including regional networks, special activities, and multipurpose cooperatives, has become more prominent. A definition of library cooperation is offered, and differences between the terms system, network, and consortium are explored. Probable future developments in library cooperation are mentioned, including applications of computer technology and potential political benefits of multi type library cooperation. © 1981 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Cost-effective networks are characterized by greater competition, less state and federal control, and more research and development.

This paper examines six objectives of price and identifies the likely outcomes associated with each objective. These objectives are market equity, social equity, maximum opportunity for participation, maximizing revenue, rationing, and commercial sector encouragement. It is unlikely that a library will have one overall pricing objective which is applicable to all of the services it delivers. The price which is ultimately adopted for any particular service will depend upon which objectives are uppermost in priority and will represent the best compromise among conflicting objectives. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,01616846,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953611517

Further, there is a discussion of an overall strategy for increasing the competence of library staff members vis a vis the problem patron, using as an example, a program developed by the Hartford Public Library.

The cataloging, done using the OCLC system, reflected a 95% find rate in the OCLC data base; the 5% original input remaining is not unusual for public libraries using this system. An investigation of the overlap of the sample with five public library collections showed a positive correlation between target library size and find rate. However, because 75% of the sample was nonfiction (higher than expected for small and medium sized public libraries, which make up the bulk of the processing center users), the processing center collection file may not be typical of the total collections of such libraries. To gain an indication of the value of the processing center file in resource sharing, a furfher study was made of the 18% of the sample not found in any of the five public libraries searched. An additional 7% of the sample was located in Indiana using the OCLC data base; the remaining 11% was not easily located in the state.

The survey instrument was based on one developed by L. J. Amey and R. J. Smith for a survey of Toronto school and public librarians. Theosophy determined that there was little difference in attitude of Iowa elementary and secondary school librarians to ward combined facilities, nor was there much difference in attitude Of Iowa public librarians serving populations under 2,500 and these serving more than 2,500 to ward combined facilities. School and public librarians did demonstrate statistically significant differences in responses to fifteen of the twenty six state menstruating to combined facilities. Compared10 respondents in the Toronto study, a larger percentage of Iowa public librarians were less concerned about the geographic inconvenience of combined facilities and perceived less duplication resuming from combination.
