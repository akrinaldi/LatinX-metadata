Nor have explicit links been made to critical librarianship (critlib), particularly regarding the stress associated with the profession and the “resilience narrative” of “doing more with less”. In this paper, we review the literature and describe our experiences introducing a variety of contemplative elements into our library instruction program, most recently in the virtual environment. Building on the three levels of “intervention” modeled by Barbezat and Bush (2014) to include librarians, and incorporating critlib theory, we describe the contemplative practices we have used with a view to alleviating librarian, student, and faculty stress and burnout, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anecdotal reports suggest a broad interest in such practices and their potential effectiveness in reducing distraction and stress. However, future study is needed to systematically evaluate the outcomes of CP during library instruction. © 2021",Contemplative pedagogy; COVID-19; Critical librarianship; Resilience; Vocational awe,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101419998

Alarmingly, answers to this question are in short supply because of patchy comparative data. This study begins to address this gap by analyzing an exhaustive compilation of 265 transparency compliance evaluations (i.e. audits) authored by NGOs, academics, and government oversight authorities across Latin America between 2003 and 2018. Aggregating data on patterns of evaluation and public sector compliance with transparency statutes, we find modest increases in compliance over time, strikingly low compliance with passive transparency compliance (i.e. governmental responses to citizen requests) at the local versus national levels of government, and significantly higher compliance scores when government oversight agencies act as evaluators. Our data also reveal worrying gaps in evaluation efforts. Evaluators tend to focus far more on active transparency (i.e. website-based disclosure) than passive transparency, more on national level governments than subnational governments, and preponderantly on the executive as opposed to legislative or judicial branches of government. Textual analyses show that education is the most evaluated policy theme, with financial policies and social services close behind. In presenting the first large-scale cross-national assessment of transparency compliance, the current study brings to light trends in the effectiveness of transparency regimes and patterns of transparency evaluation across Latin America. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Compliance; Evaluation; Freedom of information; Latin America; Transparency,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100671116

However, assigning keywords has gained particular importance in the current open scientific communication ecosystem in digital environments, mainly in the academic dissertation and repositories of theses. This article reports a study on the organization of knowledge, using subject-access metadata of master's theses from the digital repository of the University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil, applying analytical techniques to a big amount of data. The objective was to analyze the number of keywords in each record and keywords repeated in the title and abstracts of the dissertations in Portuguese and English. The analysis of the 48,501 metadata records of master's theses submitted to the repository, between 2001 and 2019, presents a total of 223,867 keywords in Portuguese, with an average of 4.62 keywords per record, and a total of 216,521 keywords in English, equivalent to an average of 4.59 per record. Although, the attribution of keywords in Portuguese and English by the author is an economic way to expand access to the content of theses and dissertations in institutional repositories, it is necessary to define rules for authors about the choice of keywords and the preparation of the abstract, as well as its translation into English.

More specifically, the proposed conceptual framework investigates the influence of organizational-related, operational-related, and co-creation-related antecedents in library service innovation and, consequently, in library performance. A structured questionnaire was developed and distributed electronically to Brazilian academic library personnel at Brazilian public universities to collect the primary data. The final sample comprised of 151 academic libraries. Results indicate that leadership and culture-climate are essential to foster an atmosphere of innovation in academic libraries. Moreover, employee capabilities promote user and frontline involvement in service innovation. Lastly, user involvement supports both incremental and radical service innovations, whereas frontline involvement only contributes to incremental innovation.

We employ a comparative case study of open government data platforms in three leading Latin American cities and draw upon the concept of boundary resources taken from platform theory. Our research generates two key contributions. First, we propose a theoretical model, which explains how an OGD platform owner is able to govern the demand and the supply side of its platform to facilitate the cultivation of a platform ecosystem. Second, we develop contributions to practice in terms of a set of recommendations for governments in emerging countries concerning how to establish and manage a vibrant OGD platform ecosystem. © 2020",Boundary resources; Governance; Latin America; Open government data platforms; Platform innovation,,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084839157

We specify a logistic model with pairs cluster bootstrapped t-statistics to account for votes nested in judges and calculate correcting standard errors. The study indicates that when appointing FOI judges close to their parties, politicians cannot count with responsive same party judges to rule in their favor when resolving FOI disputes. Nonetheless, ideology is a strong predictor of judges' decisions when resolving FOI disputes related to privacy and commercial secrets. In doing so, the study enhances our understanding of the behavior of administrative judges working in agencies in charge of controlling the government and sheds light on the role of ideology on adjudication in FOI disputes -an area of law barely explored empirically. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Freedom of information; Ideology; Judicial behavior; Partisanship; Transparency,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066947510

We explore whether public officials are more likely to respond to requests from citizens that are informed about their right under the RTI law vs regular citizens, as well as from influential citizens (journalists and firm owners). We also assess whether public servants’ responses to RTI requests are gender-biased. We conducted a randomized field experiment to test for unequal treatment given to citizens’ requests by Uruguayan government officials, considering different citizen categories. We find that only those citizens who know the RTI law and invoke its existence have a greater likelihood of obtaining an answer from bureaucrats. This result is driven mostly by men's requests declaring they know the law when making their request, while invoking the law doesn't make a difference in responses to women.

A number of factors impacting access to the DC-CAN are identified including: a lack of ISPs willing to provide last mile service and a highly concentrated market structure for broadband in the local market. In term of the adoption of the DC-CAN, the findings point to various successes such as meeting the proposal's goals for signing up enough community anchor institutions (CAIs) to participate in the DC-CAN.

Current research suggests that social media adoption in government has been mainly market driven and that the various adoption strategies have resulted from a combination of trial and error, imitation, and both informal and formal knowledge exchanges. Given the nature of the adoption process and the nature of social media, the use of social media in government involves high levels of risk and uncertainty, and the main barriers of adoption lay in the organizational and institutional arrangements of government organizations. Nevertheless, little or no research has looked for the ways in which government organizations design strategies or use social media. In this paper, we open the black box to look at the process of adoption and implementation of social media in a government-lead social marketing program to promote healthy habits among young people living in urban areas, the Puebla Sana (Healthy Puebla) program. The case suggests that commercial social media, such as Facebook, Youtube, or Twitter, are instances of sociomaterial systems, and to take advantage of their features, government organizations need to collaborate with multiple individual and organizational actors in the co-creation of a message to accomplish their goals. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Assemble view of technology; Electronic government; Mexico; Social marketing; Social media; Sociomateriality; Web 2.0,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84993123322

In emerging democracies, during political crises or controversial elections, reliable information is often difficult to obtain. In authoritarian regimes, citizens' perceptions of information reliability are tightly linked to trust in government, and both are typically low. Open government policies help build trust that is essential during protests or contentious elections. Uses and gratifications (U&G) theory states that people use diverse media to try to satisfy their need for reliable information. Gratifying this need is tied to the larger concept of political information efficacy (PIE), i.e., the belief a person holds about him/herself as being politically informed and competent to participate in political thought and action. We investigated these inter-related concepts by administering a survey to an opportunity sample of young adults at a public state university in Mexico. We find that respondents perceived that information from face-to-face and telephone communication with members of their social network, as well as online sources were the most reliable. Information from offline sources, such as TV and newspapers, especially pro-government sources, were the least reliable. Further, the information factors of availability, reliability, influence and sharing had positive relationships with PIE. These results suggest that in conditions of uncertain political information, social networks and online information sources are essential to political information efficacy and democratic political participation.

They bring with them a variety of meanings for OGD. The purpose of this paper is to show how the different stakeholders and their different perspectives on OGD can be analyzed in a given context. Taking Chile as an OGD exemplar, stakeholder analysis is used to identify and categorize stakeholder groups in terms of their relative power and interest as either primary (in this case, politicians, public officials, public sector practitioners, international organizations) or secondary (civil society activists, funding donors, ICT providers, academics). Stakeholder groups sometimes associated with OGD but absent from significant involvement in Chile – such as private sector- and citizen-users – are also identified. Four different perspectives on open government data – bureaucratic, political, technological, and economic – are identified from a literature review. Template analysis is used to analyze text – OGD-related reports, conference presentations, and interviews in Chile – in terms of those perspectives. This shows bureaucratic and political perspectives to be more dominant than the other two, and also some presence for a politico-economic perspective not identified from the original literature review. The information value chain is used to identify a “missing middle” in current Chilean OGD perspectives: a lack of connection between a reality of data provision and an aspiration of developmental results. This pattern of perspectives can be explained by the capacities and interests of key stakeholders, with those in turn being shaped by Chile's history, politics, and institutions. Overall, stakeholder analysis and perspectives analysis are shown from this case to be workable techniques for OGD that add value by exposing the identity, power, motivations, and worldview of key actors. They provide a necessary foundation of knowledge for both researchers and practitioners who need to understand the different meanings of OGD in any particular context. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Chile; Open government data; Perspectives analysis; Stakeholder analysis,,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948798193

Box 16500, Aalto, FI 00076, Finland","Growing flexibility in work arrangements, particularly in the knowledge industries, and the ensuing possibilities for teleworking are challenging the traditional ways of conceptualizing and designing public spaces and public services. As an example of this development, public and university libraries are studied from the point of view of teleworking. Although work still only accounts for a small amount of the activities that take place in libraries, its transformations can be seen as a 'weak signal' of newly emerging spatial arrangements. In addition to the home and workplace, teleworkers are using a network of public, semi-public and private spaces (so-called third places) for different types of working. The research used the concept ""spatial portfolio"" to address this phenomenon of spatial modalities. The new role of public libraries within this context is discussed. In addition to their traditional functions of lending books and providing spaces for reading newspapers and magazines, libraries are now becoming more multifunctional, providing space for different activities, including work. This new phenomenon has been studied empirically by conducting a qualitative interview and observing teleworkers in two public libraries and one university library in the City of Helsinki, Finland. The objective was to find and analyze different profiles of workers in libraries, thus providing input for future planning and design of these spaces, as well as the urban fabric around them. The results show that a considerable range of activities within research and education, art and culture, information technology, business and finance, and social services and government are performed in the libraries, all of which are in part supported by the new concepts and policies of the city. Libraries can be seen as 'transitory workspaces' where people work at least a couple of hours per week and for different reasons such as free wifi connection and location. Also, libraries might be considered 'spatial incubators' or rather places able to attract people who start up their own activities. These concepts contribute to define a new way of appropriating libraries. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930571168

What were the issues at stake that led to the promulgation of four informatics laws in such a short space of time? What led these debates from market protectionism and national sovereignty to globalization and market competitiveness? These questions can be answered by the a priori definition of groups and interests. However, the choice in this article is to follow the actors and their own strategies of formation and dissolution of groups, focusing on the tracks left by the debates in Congress, especially those formally recorded in congressional documents and in the press. © 2013 by the University of Texas Press.",,,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107696467

The conclusions of the analysis are 1) that governments' participation in social media may result in improved communication and citizen participation, more transparency, and transfer of best practices among government agencies; 2) that a good implementation strategy is necessary to realize these benefits and to avoid risks; and 3) that the implementation of social media highlights the importance of updating laws and regulations, and of promoting changes in government culture and organizational practices. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Electronic government; Mexico; Social media; Strategy; Web 2.0,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866269244

However, many e-Government projects fail to deliver their promises in terms of specific outcomes. Some of such failures are the result of a lack of understanding about the relationships among technologies, information use, organizational factors, institutional arrangements, and socio-economic contexts involved in the selection, implementation, and use of information and communication technologies (ICT), producing mismatches and unintended consequences. This paper proposes the use of institutional theory and dynamic simulation, particularly system dynamics, as an integrated and comprehensive approach to understand e-Government phenomena. Combining a sound theory and a sophisticated analytical technique will help to improve our understanding about ICT in government settings. The paper draws on the case of the e-Mexico program, particularly on the strategy to create web-based content portals for citizens in the areas of education, health, economy, and government. Using the same technological infrastructure and under the leadership of the same Federal Ministry, four different networks of government and non-government organizations engaged in the creation of internet portals and their content. The results provide evidence to demonstrate important bidirectional relationships between formal processes (institutions), agency networks (organizational forms), and the resulting characteristics of the four thematic portals (enacted technology). © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",E-Mexico; Government portal; Institutional theory; Mexico; System dynamics; Technology enactment framework,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959249689

From recent experiences around the world, it seems clear that in order to enjoy some of the greatest benefits of digital government, the integration of information across organizational boundaries is necessary. However, these digital government initiatives face additional challenges, since the required level of interorganizational collaboration and trust is often not supported by existing institutional arrangements, organizational structures, and managerial processes. In fact, many institutions and administrative structures found in government contexts offer incentives for single-agency work only, which produces stove-pipe systems. Based on an extensive case study in the Mexican federal government, this paper explores how certain institutional arrangements and organizational structures can enable or hinder cross-agency collaboration and consequently, interorganizational information integration. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The establishment of Prodasen was to spearhead the reform movement of the Senate administration and operation, and to provide the Congress with up-to-date, timely, and relevant information to enable the members to exercise their constitutional function. Because of the centrality of Prodasen, both as an information provider and as an example of a modern congressional staff unit, examining its creation, goals, and operations can illustrate the promises and dilemmas of congressional staff in Brazil, their present role in the legislative process, and the challenges they face under the new democratic regime. © 1994.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149144541

They note two conclusions: 1) There is an immediate and compelling need to find an appropriate definition of the information sector and appropriate methods for measuring the size and performance of this sector, and 2) There is a need for an in-depth review of information law, legislation, regulations, functions, and agencies of government.1 These observations appearing in the second volume of the U.S. Department of Education's OERI Library Programs project, Issues in Library Research: Proposals for the Nineties, underscore the importance of the OTA report, Informing the Nation. © 1989.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-45249128853

All too frequently, however, government documents collections are underutilized by faculty and students, overlooked by librarians as resources that support academic programs, and are developed independently of overall library collection building policies. This article offers suggestions for developing a collection policy that promotes the integration of government documents into an academic library's overall collection management objectives. © 1989.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38249025792

The development of official publishing since de facto independence in 1808 reflects the country's administrative history. Bibliographic control, at least of federal level publishing, is now at last being achieved, but distribution is still poorly organized, and edition size often fails to correspond with demand. The range of material is vast, although publishing trends tend to reflect the importance of personalism in government in Brazil. Technical and esthetic standards are briefly touched upon. © 1984.",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48749138368
