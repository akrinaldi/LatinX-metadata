This article shows, however, that the (secondary) liability of domain registries and registrars, and more specifically country code top-level domain (ccTLD) registries for website content, has been tested in several EU Member States in recent years. The article investigates tendencies in the national lower-court jurisprudence and explores to what extent the liability exemption regime of the E-Commerce Directive applies to domain registries.

Some features of blockchain technologies - scarcity, trust, transparency, decentralized public records and smart contracts - seem to make this technology compatible with the fundamentals of copyright. Authors can publish works on blockchain creating a quasi-immutable record of initial ownership, and encode 'smart' contracts to license the use of works. Remuneration may happen on online distribution platforms where the smart contracts reside. In theory, such an automated setup allows for the private ordering of copyright. Blockchain technology, like Digital Rights Management 20 years ago, is thus presented as an opportunity to reduce market friction, and increase both licensing efficiency and the autonomy of creators. Yet, some of the old problems remain.

These distribute control among the players rather than requiring a centralized database, and so can reduce costs and speed-up transactions. However, when it is used for assets which exist outside the blockchain itself, an unmodified adoption of the technology would bypass legal and regulatory requirements which, for these kinds of assets, cannot be bypassed without fundamental change to the law. Building those requirements into any blockchain-based system introduces features which are not necessary for performing its core functions, and we call these 'legal impurities'. The most important legal impurities required are those relating to identification of the parties, and introducing the ability of a trusted third party to make modifications to the ledger. Not only does introducing these legal impurities make fundamental changes to the concept behind blockchain, but it is also essential that they are implemented in ways which do not threaten the integrity of the blockchain as evidence.

According to the Commission, online services providing access to copyright protected content uploaded by their users without the involvement of right holders have become main sources of access to content online. This affects right holders' possibilities to determine whether, and under which conditions, their works and other subject matters are used as well as their possibilities to get an appropriate remuneration for them (value gap). In order to close the reported value gap between right holders and online platforms, the Proposal for a Directive on copyright within the digital single market strategy endorses a wider definition of the communication to the public and imposes new control obligations on ISPs. Such a policy choice raises some concerns. First, it is doubtful whether the Proposal is consistent with both the interpretation of the notion of communication to the public provided by the European Court of Justice case law and the safe harbor granted by the e-Commerce Directive. Moreover, the Proposal is not supported by any empirical evidence. The lack of robust statistical evidence of displacement of sales by online copyright infringements undermines the ratio of the intervention, that is, the reported value gap and the consequent need to assure the right holders of an adequate remuneration for the circulation of works on the Internet.", "citedby-count": "5", "affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021796", "afid": "60021796", "affilname": "Universit\u00e0 Bocconi", "affiliation-city": "Milan", "affiliation-country": "Italy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020919", "afid": "60020919", "affilname": "Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Basilicata", "affiliation-city": "Potenza", "affiliation-country": "Italy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012708", "afid": "60012708", "affilname": "Stanford University", "affiliation-city": "Palo Alto", "affiliation-country": "United States"}], "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "subtypeDescription": "Article", "author-count": {"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$": "2"}, "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195980500", "authid": "57195980500", "authname": "Colangelo G.", "surname": "Colangelo", "given-name": "Giuseppe", "initials": "G.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60020919"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60012708"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54395752800", "authid": "54395752800", "authname": "Maggiolino M.", "surname": "Maggiolino", "given-name": "Mariateresa", "initials": "M.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60021796"}]}], "authkeywords": "Copyright | Digital single market | Intermediary liability | Internet service providers | Online platforms | Safe harbors", "source-id": "145600", "fund-no": "undefined", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessFlag": false}, {"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048542203"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048542203?field=author,affiliation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048542203&origin=inward"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048542203&origin=inward"}], "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048542203", "dc:identifier": "SCOPUS_ID:85048542203", "eid": "2-s2.0-85048542203", "dc:title": "Turning the crossroad for a connected world: Reshaping the European prospect for the Internet of Things", "dc:creator": "\u00dcnver M.B.", "prism:publicationName": "International Journal of Law and Information Technology", "prism:issn": "09670769", "prism:eIssn": "14643693", "prism:volume": "26", "prism:issueIdentifier": "2", "prism:pageRange": "93-118", "prism:coverDate": "2018-06-01", "prism:coverDisplayDate": "1 June 2018", "prism:doi": "10.1093/ijlit/eay003", "dc:description": "The Internet of Things (IoT) depicts a world of networked smart objects, including cars, home appliances and wearable devices, which all require 'interoperability' to be used with seamless communication and data exchange. Interoperability will not be successfully achieved unless IoT users are pre-empted from being locked into specific (eg proprietary) ecosystems. Enabling IoT interoperability requires a comprehensive approach that does not just depend on standardization and intellectual property policies, which often end up being fragmented, diverse and niche solutions. Focusing on the EU toolbox, this study elaborates on the pertinent legal rules, precedents and selfregulatory mechanisms, and ultimately finds that existing measures are far from effective, coherent and forward-looking. Addressing this problem requires a policy making strategy based on a balance struck between IoT standardization and innovation, which suggests finding of the least intrusive and costly tool. Given this fact, enabling IoT (non-personal as well as personal) data be ported across different ecosystems is found to be the ideal solution, with the view to lessen vendor lock-in and keep the pace of innovation. Last but not least, it is concluded that technologically oriented measures as well as overambitious goals should be refrained to avoid 'type errors' in this technically complex and multifaceted area, where a holistic perspective is increasingly difficult to adopt.", "citedby-count": "4", "affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60170474", "afid": "60170474", "affilname": "Faculty of Business and Law", "affiliation-city": "Cambridge", "affiliation-country": "United Kingdom"}], "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "subtypeDescription": "Article", "author-count": {"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$": "1"}, "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56993262300", "authid": "56993262300", "authname": "\u00dcnver M.B.", "surname": "\u00dcnver", "given-name": "Mehmet Bilal", "initials": "M.B.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60170474"}]}], "authkeywords": "Competition law | Data portability | Electronic communications | Intellectual property rights | Internet of Things | Interoperability | Standardization", "source-id": "145600", "fund-no": "undefined", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessFlag": false}, {"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048538789"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048538789?field=author,affiliation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048538789&origin=inward"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048538789&origin=inward"}], "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048538789", "dc:identifier": "SCOPUS_ID:85048538789", "eid": "2-s2.0-85048538789", "dc:title": "Are online consumers protected from geo-blocking practices within the European Union?", "dc:creator": "Rojas M.L.F.", "prism:publicationName": "International Journal of Law and Information Technology", "prism:issn": "09670769", "prism:eIssn": "14643693", "prism:volume": "26", "prism:issueIdentifier": "2", "prism:pageRange": "119-141", "prism:coverDate": "2018-06-01", "prism:coverDisplayDate": "1 June 2018", "prism:doi": "10.1093/ijlit/eay004", "dc:description": "Geo-blocking as a technological protection measure directly affects e-commerce in the European Union, reinforcing discriminatory practices in the online world.

The article also illustrates how the role of technology in virtual law firms have changed over time, from being a source of differentiation to enabling and supporting the business, and, finally, to becoming embedded in the organization as a commodity.", "citedby-count": "1", "affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068730", "afid": "60068730", "affilname": "OsloMet \u2013 storbyuniversitetet", "affiliation-city": "Oslo", "affiliation-country": "Norway"}], "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "subtypeDescription": "Article", "author-count": {"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$": "2"}, "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16643587900", "authid": "16643587900", "authname": "Skj\u00f8lsvik T.", "surname": "Skj\u00f8lsvik", "given-name": "Tale", "initials": "T.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60068730"}]}, {"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54580596200", "authid": "54580596200", "authname": "Breunig K.", "surname": "Breunig", "given-name": "Karl Joachim", "initials": "K.J.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60068730"}]}], "authkeywords": "Enacted technologies | Institutional change | Organizational archetypes | Technological change | Virtual law firms", "source-id": "145600", "fund-no": "undefined", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessFlag": false}, {"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041050850"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041050850?field=author,affiliation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85041050850&origin=inward"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85041050850&origin=inward"}], "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85041050850", "dc:identifier": "SCOPUS_ID:85041050850", "eid": "2-s2.0-85041050850", "dc:title": "Why keep a dog and bark yourself?

In this context, online intermediaries' governance would move away from a well-established utilitarian approach and towards a moral approach by rejecting negligence-based intermediary liability arrangements. Miscellaneous policy tools-such as monitoring and filtering obligations, blocking orders, graduated response, payment blockades and follow-the-money strategies, private Domain Name System content regulation, online search manipulation, or administrative enforcement-might reflect this change in perspective. In particular, policy makers-and interested third-parties such as intellectual property rightholders-try to coerce online intermediaries into implementing these policy strategies through voluntary measures and self-regulation, in addition to validly enacted obligations. This process might be pushing an amorphous notion of responsibility that incentivizes intermediaries' self-intervention to police allegedly infringing activities in the Internet. In this sense, the intermediary liability discourse is shifting towards an intermediary responsibility discourse. Furthermore, enforcement would be looking once again for an 'answer to the machine in the machine'. By enlisting online intermediaries as watchdogs, governments would de facto delegate online enforcement to algorithmic tools. Due process and fundamental guarantees get mauled by technological enforcement, curbing fair uses of content online and silencing speech according to the mainstream ethical discourse.", "citedby-count": "14", "affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60208602", "afid": "60208602", "affilname": "Centre d'Etudes Internationales de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle", "affiliation-city": "Strasbourg", "affiliation-country": "France"}, {"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024724", "afid": "60024724", "affilname": "University of Strathclyde", "affiliation-city": "Glasgow", "affiliation-country": "United Kingdom"}, {"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024053", "afid": "60024053", "affilname": "Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore", "affiliation-city": "Milan", "affiliation-country": "Italy"}, {"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010417", "afid": "60010417", "affilname": "Stanford Law School", "affiliation-city": "Stanford", "affiliation-country": "United States"}, {"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008724", "afid": "60008724", "affilname": "Duke University", "affiliation-city": "Durham", "affiliation-country": "United States"}], "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "subtypeDescription": "Article", "author-count": {"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$": "1"}, "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57193028874", "authid": "57193028874", "authname": "Frosio G.F.", "surname": "Frosio", "given-name": "Giancarlo F.", "initials": "G.F.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60208602"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60010417"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60008724"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60024724"}, {"@_fa": "true", "$": "60024053"}]}], "authkeywords": "Copyright | Defamation | Enforcement | Free speech | Intellectual property | Intermediary liability | Internet governance | Platforms", "source-id": "145600", "fund-no": "undefined", "openaccess": "0", "openaccessFlag": false, "freetoread": {"value": [{"$": "all"}, {"$": "repository"}, {"$": "repositoryvor"}, {"$": "repositoryam"}]}, "freetoreadLabel": {"value": [{"$": "All Open Access"}, {"$": "Green"}]}}, {"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055104605"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055104605?field=author,affiliation"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055104605&origin=inward"}, {"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85055104605&origin=inward"}], "prism:url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85055104605", "dc:identifier": "SCOPUS_ID:85055104605", "eid": "2-s2.0-85055104605", "dc:title": "Intermediary publishers and European data protection: Delimiting the ambit of responsibility for third-party rights through a synthetic interpretation of the EU acquis", "dc:creator": "Erdos D.", "prism:publicationName": "International Journal of Law and Information Technology", "prism:issn": "09670769", "prism:eIssn": "14643693", "prism:volume": "26", "prism:issueIdentifier": "3", "prism:pageRange": "189-225", "prism:coverDate": "2018-01-01", "prism:coverDisplayDate": "2018", "prism:doi": "10.1093/IJLIT/EAY007", "dc:description": "With the explosion of computer technology, vastly more and more varied types of data related to individuals are being disseminated online, often without their consent. While intermediary publishers are not the initial and immediate cause of this, they generally play a contributory role and engage in further (semi-)autonomous processing such as organizing or promoting content. Current case law rather haphazardly recognizes intermediary publishers to be data protection 'controllers' and/or protected by the intermediary 'host' shield, while also acknowledging the engagement of general human rights law. Seeking to synthetically balance the competing purposes which underlie these three legal frameworks, this article argues that greater responsibility should flow from more autonomous control but that some shielding is still necessary for all intermediary publishers. Conceptually it is argued that such a synthetic approach leads to intermediary publishers being grouped into three increasingly autonomous categories-'processor hosts', 'controller hosts' and 'independent intermediaries'- which should be subject to a successively greater ambit of responsibility accordingly. Detailed elaboration of the resulting duties must also take account of the seriousness of the potential interference with competing rights and, in this regard, should give weight to the divergent resource capacity of otherwise similarly situated actors.", "citedby-count": "1", "affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031101", "afid": "60031101", "affilname": "University of Cambridge", "affiliation-city": "Cambridge", "affiliation-country": "United Kingdom"}], "prism:aggregationType": "Journal", "subtype": "ar", "subtypeDescription": "Article", "author-count": {"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$": "1"}, "author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/16233201300", "authid": "16233201300", "authname": "Erdos D.", "surname": "Erdos", "given-name": "David", "initials": "D.", "afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$": "60031101"}]}], "authkeywords": "Data protection | Directive 2000/31 | Intermediary liability | Privacy | Regulation 2016/679 | Reputation | Right to be forgotten | Social media", "source-id": "145600", "fund-acr": "ESRC", "fund-no": "ES/M010236/1", "fund-sponsor": "Economic and Social Research Council", "openaccess": "1", "openaccessFlag": true, "freetoread": {"value": [{"$": "all"}, {"$": "publisherhybridgold"}, {"$": "repository"}, {"$": "repositoryvor"}, {"$": "repositoryam"}]}, "freetoreadLabel": {"value": [{"$": "All Open Access"}, {"$": "Hybrid Gold"}, {"$": "Green"}]}}]}}
